2012/4/10@Consider the heated debate about whether or not Google paid too much for Motorola Mobility and its patents, or Kodak's failure to turn its patents into cash in time to avoid bankruptcy, despite it being, ironically, the original developer of digital photography.
2012/4/10@The purchase will put the software giant in control of some of the core patents from the early days of the internet, adding to an arsenal that already overshadows those of rivals such as Google and Apple and potentially opening a new front in the industry's patent wars.
2012/4/10@"Microsoft is looking at Google sitting on a pile of basic infrastructure patents and wanted to respond.
2012/4/12@A generous research and development tax credit has enhanced France's ability to attract inward investment, with Microsoft, Google and Huawei among multinationals taking advantage.
2012/4/12@This relatively new development from the US is spreading to the UK as an evolution of the already common practice of recruiters conducting online research into candidates, such as viewing their public profiles on social networking sites and carrying out Google searches.
2012/4/12@Remember when it seemed crazy that Google was paying $1.65bn for YouTube?
2012/4/12@Internet search company Google has announced it is to apply for its own domain.
2012/4/13@Google announces stock split
2012/4/13@Google has announced an unusual stock split that will effectively hand founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lifetime control of the search engine they invented as graduate students 16 years ago.
2012/4/13@The decision to cement control for what Mr Page called "the very long term" marks what corporate governance experts described as a first for a big public company in the US, while also resulting in a second class of Google shares trading on Wall Street.
2012/4/13@Under the first stock split in its eight years as a public company, Google said it would issue a new share for each of its shares already outstanding.
2012/4/13@The decision marks a lifetime extension of the controversial experiment in corporate governance that Google announced at the time of its initial public offering in 2004.
2012/4/13@Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said the founders had full authority over how Google is run: "The board is controlled by them .
2012/4/13@The news came as Google reported a stronger jump in earnings in its latest quarter than Wall Street had expected, calming some of the concerns left from the shortfall recorded in its previous quarter.

2012/4/14@Google split poser for investors
2012/4/14@The prospect of nearly indistinguishable rival Google stocks emerged on Thursday as the search company said it would give investors one share of a new non-voting C class of stock for each share they already own.
2012/4/14@The Google plan has already drawn criticism from some corporate governance activists.
2012/4/14@I can show them on Google maps.
2012/4/14@Little to choose from in Google share split
2012/4/14@The prospect of nearly indistinguishable rival Google stocks emerged on Thursday as the search company said it would give investors one share of a new non-voting C class of stock for each share they already own.
2012/4/14@The Google plan has already drawn criticism from some corporate governance activists.
2012/4/14@Google   fell 1.2 per cent to $624.60 over the week.
2012/4/16@Anil Hansjee, former head of M&A for Google in Europe, and Johnny Hornby, co-founder of Clemmow Hornby Inge, the UK advertising agency, are also senior advisers.
2012/4/16@Google faces court challenge from Oracle
2012/4/16@With such an outcome, Oracle would probably be required to offer Google a licence to its technology at rates that analysts say should not however cripple Android's competitiveness.
2012/4/16@Oracle first instigated legal proceedings against Google in August 2010, but its initial case, in which it sought damages of more than $6bn, has been scaled back significantly.
2012/4/16@Oracle alleges that Google has infringed its copyright in the Java programming language, which Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems two years ago.
2012/4/16@Google lawyers have maintained that copyright does not apply because Oracle's suit centres on features of the Android software that do not themselves directly replicate the Java software, but were written using the technology.
2012/4/16@Evidence expected to be presented by Oracle at trial includes an email by a Google engineer which said that the search company should seek a licence from Oracle to use Java.
2012/4/16@However, Google lawyers have said that this resulted from an internal review that only took place when it became clear that Oracle might sue.
2012/4/16@Why didn't Google just sign up for a licence and move on?
2012/4/16@Oracle's lawsuit alleges that when Google used the Java programming language as the basis for its Android mobile operating system - without taking a licence - it misappropriated intellectual property Oracle acquired when Oracle bought Java, along with Sun Microsystems, in 2009.
2012/4/16@As Oracle tells it, Google built Android out of Java building blocks so that it would be easy for the legions of existing Java developers to write Android applications.
2012/4/16@Yet it is a bit hard to see how Google has harmed Java developers by building the first viable mobile operating system they can use and profit from.
2012/4/16@Of course, all of this is only relevant if Google is found to have violated Oracle's intellectual property, which Google denies.
2012/4/16@With such an outcome, Oracle would probably be required to offer Google a licence to its technology at rates that analysts say should not cripple Android's competitiveness, however.
2012/4/16@Oracle first instigated legal proceedings against Google in August 2010, but its initial case, in which it sought damages of more than $6bn, has been scaled back significantly.

2012/4/16@Google pioneered the technology industry's dismal trend of stripping shareholders of voting rights with its initial public offering in 1994.
2012/4/16@Google set up a special committee of board members that took 15 months to agree to the proposal, having "retained its own financial and legal advisers".
2012/4/16@To add insult to injury, Mr Brin and Mr Page have written to shareholders citing the "clear, well-publicised expectations we established for investors in 2004" and expressing satisfaction that "we have protected Google from outside pressure".
2012/4/16@Google has been successful but what happens when something goes wrong and investors want to challenge Mr Page, its chief executive?
2012/4/16@The current effort by Third Point, a hedge fund, to challenge Yahoo by placing its own slate of directors on the board would be impossible in Google or Groupon's cases.
2012/4/17@But   Apple and Google dragged down the sector, with both more than 2.5 per cent lower.
2012/4/17@Apple fell below the $600 mark to end 4.2 per cent lower at $580.13, while Google fell 3 per cent to $606.07.
2012/4/17@The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent, although Wall Street put in a mixed showing as heavy selling of Apple and Google shares offset a rise for Citi shares and encouraging US retail sales data.
2012/4/17@However, shares in Apple and Google dragged down the tech sector, with both companies moving more than 2.5 per cent lower.
2012/4/17@Apple fell below the $600 mark to finish 4.2 per cent lower at $580.13, while Google declined 3 per cent to $606.07.
2012/4/17@The sector provides more than 25,000 jobs and companies such as Lufthansa, Shell, Google and HSBC have set up back-office operations in the city.
2012/4/17@Walmart yesterday nominated Marissa Mayer of Google to its board of directors in a further attempt to capitalise on internet and mobile sales.
2012/4/18@No one's forced to invest in Google
2012/4/18@Nobody is forced to invest in Google or any other company.
2012/4/18@Almost all shareholders in Google can sell if they don't like the new structure, and maybe a loss of market confidence will convince the company to scrap the deal.
2012/4/18@Buying Google stock has always been a vote of confidence on the leadership of the two founders - if you trust them, it shouldn't matter whether you can vote or not.
2012/4/18@Oracle looked at buying manufacturers   Research In Motion or Palm in 2009 as part of a plan to break into the smartphone business in direct competition with Apple's iPhone, a lawyer for Google said in court.
2012/4/18@The claim came as Google opened its defence   yesterday against a $1bn copyright and patent infringement complaint from Oracle over the internet search company's Android smartphone operating system.
2012/4/18@Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, also approached Google about an alliance between the companies, but was rebuffed, Mr Van Nest added.
2012/4/18@A separate allegation that Google infringed seven Java patents was whittled down to two patents ahead of the trial, with claims for damages on those expected to be less than $10m.
2012/4/18@Judge William Alsup also revealed that Google last month offered to pay Oracle $2bn.
2012/4/19@The unit launched several new payment offerings in the first quarter that it plans to test through the year, challenging similar experiments from Visa, American Express, Google and Square, a start-up in San Francisco.
2012/4/19@The land grab in mobile payments, which has already attracted start-ups including Square and global behemoths such as Google and the big telecoms carriers, may limit PayPal's ability to expand, and crimp its margins.
2012/4/19@More than 15,000 students are quizzed each year about their ideal employers (Apple and Google are the favourites - again) and how they feel about work.
2012/4/2@I cannot think why else the chancellor of the exchequer and the executive chairman of Google would use the words "we" and "our" when announcing UK national strategies and initiatives, in their article "California dreaming in such a British way" (March 29).
2012/4/2@When I last checked on the web, Google was a major US-based private sector company with its own corporate interests.
2012/4/20@The unit launched several initiatives in the first quarter that it plans to test throughout the year on competing with the Visa, American Express and Google in the race to create "mobile wallet" offerings.
2012/4/21@Google and Oracle chiefs testify in Android dispute;
2012/4/21@But when Larry Ellison of Oracle and Larry Page of Google testified this week in a courtroom in San Francisco, the discussion quickly moved on to abstruse technical points of software code - something even the chief executives sometimes seemed unsure about.
2012/4/21@The 15m lines of code in Android are not themselves under the microscope, but whether Google acted illegally by following a format developed for Java when it wrote its system's APIs - the software interfaces that enable other developers to write programs that are compatible with it.
2012/4/21@The tornado in question knocked out the paper's printing plant, so it used Google Docs to post information about missing persons.
2012/4/21@Presumably the likes of Google and Facebook are licking their lips as they contemplate their role in creating digital identities where your punctuality on eBay, efficiency on TaskRabbit and cleanliness as an Airbnb guest can be stitched together in a seamless tapestry of reputational capital.
2012/4/23@McKinsey and News Corp are down; Google and Facebook are up.
2012/4/23@So let us look at three ostensibly similar companies - the internet trio of Microsoft, Google and Amazon.
2012/4/23@Amazon, at the opposite end of the spectrum, had almost 90 per cent growth, with Google in between.
2012/4/23@Amazon's accounts for 92 per cent , with Google again somewhere in between.
2012/4/23@If Google's plan goes ahead, outside shareholders will end up with a claim on an entity that gives them no direct access to profits and cash flows, because Google pays no dividend.
2012/4/23@The Google case is to my mind symptomatic of a shift in the balance of power in recent decades from physical to human capital.
2012/4/23@The market capitalisation, when I last looked, was $197bn, putting Google in fourth place behind Apple, Microsoft and IBM.
2012/4/25@Nokia has struggled against fierce competition in the premium smartphone market dominated by Apple and Google in spite of a nascent partnership with Microsoft to produce Windows phones as it phases out the Symbian operating system.
2012/4/25@Google founder targets new frontier as he backs plan to mine asteroids
2012/4/25@Google is also backing the Google Lunar X Prize, a $30m award to the first privately funded company able to land a robot on the surface of the moon.
2012/4/25@Ross Perot Jnr, the son of the former US presidential candidate, and Ram Shriram, a founding member of the Google board, have also invested in the company.
2012/4/25@Google in drive to access and store files;
2012/4/25@Google has made its long-awaited move into the market for storing and accessing online files, a world that has suddenly become highly competitive as rival internet companies have come to see it as a key part of a new computing platform that links the "cloud" to mobile devices.
2012/4/25@The service, called Google Drive, will provide a single place for users to store many different types of file, such as documents and photos.
2012/4/25@Google also said it would let other online services draw on Drive, turning it into a storage and syncing "utility" for a wider range of online applications and centralising data storage and access.
2012/4/25@Google billionaires Larry Page and Eric Schmidt are reputedly interested in backing a space mission to seek mineral wealth on asteroids.
2012/4/25@What Google can learn from the tobacco companies
2012/4/25@Contrast this with the known unknowns of, say Google which, like any technology company, faces a significant risk of disruption.
2012/4/25@Over the past four years, Google shares have delivered a total return of 10.5 per cent (2.5 per cent per annum), whereas PMI shares have delivered a total return of 95.4 per cent (18.2 per cent per annum).
2012/4/25@Well, Google is now the only mega-cap (greater than $100bn market cap) technology company that does not pay a dividend.
2012/4/25@And just this month Google decided to further consolidate control with its founders, in a move that will effectively insulate it from all other shareholders.
2012/4/25@It is anyone's guess what will transpire over the next four years, but maybe Google should learn a few things from PMI?
2012/4/26@When the tech industry got serious about using its assets for good, we saw efforts such as Google tracking dengue fever outbreaks.
2012/4/26@At nearly 40 per cent, its operating profit margin matches those of Microsoft and Google - software companies with the sort of business models that once seemed far superior to the hardware business.
2012/4/27@Google Drive
2012/4/27@Google Drive, launched on Tuesday, is a long-awaited service from the company that stores all types of files in its cloud as well as copying them to all your devices.
2012/4/27@If you already use Google Docs for creating and editing documents in the cloud, the conversion to Drive is fairly painless.
2012/4/27@The Docs label is replaced in the top menu bar in Google by Drive, and all your files are stored under MyDrive.
2012/4/27@Google also prompts you to install a program on your laptop or desktop PC.
2012/4/27@This creates a local Google Drive folder where sub-folders can be created and any type of file dragged in.
2012/4/27@I was less keen that the Drive program automatically downloaded all my existing Google Docs to my desktop folder since I had been happy keeping just one copy of all those files in the cloud.
2012/4/27@So far, Google Drive has an Android app, but none for the iPhone.
2012/4/27@Google sees Drive as a platform for third-party apps to use.
2012/4/27@SkyDrive also gives you remote access to your main PC and allows you to stream video from it - a feature lacking in Google Drive.
2012/4/27@Microsoft has undercut Google on price and free capacity.
2012/4/27@This is insufficient to dent the dominance of Apple and Samsung, but it represents a faster rate of shipment than Google managed after it launched its Android platform.
2012/4/27@US hires lawyer for Google case
2012/4/27@Google refused to comment.
2012/4/27@Google faced a similar threat three years ago from the DoJ, which brought in a litigator to look into its proposed search partnership with Yahoo, and dropped its plans when a lawsuit was close to being filed two months later.
2012/4/27@Legal experts have warned that bringing a successful complaint against Google could prove difficult under US law unless the government can turn up clear evidence the search company deliberately set out to harm competitors.
2012/4/27@US hires top lawyer to lead Google antitrust case
2012/4/27@Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the FTC, said yesterday that Beth Wilkinson, a partner in the litigation department of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York, had been appointed to take charge of the agency's Google investigation.
2012/4/27@Google refused to comment.

2012/4/27@Legal experts have warned that bringing a successful complaint against Google could prove difficult under US law unless the government can turn up clear evidence that the search company deliberately set out to harm competitors.
2012/4/27@Complaints to the government have centred on damage other companies say they have suffered by being relegated in Google's search rankings and by the alleged preferential treatment Google has given in its search results to its in-house services in areas such as maps and comparison shopping.
2012/4/28@PS - I just learnt through Google that the word "laderhausen" can, indeed, be found in Silesian dialect.
2012/4/28@Planetary Resources has backing from Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google and is being advised by James Cameron, the director of blockbuster movies such as Avatar and Titanic .
2012/4/28@Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the billionaire Google entrepreneurs, are among a star-studded cast investing in a small US start-up that promises to bring back untold riches from outer space.
2012/4/28@I had to Google 'world events' for that year,
2012/4/28@Somehow, with her, one gets the sense that Google is not in play.
2012/4/28@Google also pioneered shares with dual-class voting structures in the tech industry, which many of its tech successors now use, including Facebook, so its founders can maintain control, says Lise Buyer, an IPO adviser who worked at Google when it was listing.
2012/4/28@Investors had high expectations of meeting the Google founders on its roadshow, but Mr Brin and Mr Page ultimately offended them with their contemptuous attitude towards Wall Street's preference to talk finances over and above the company's technology.
2012/4/28@Leaving the roadshow to Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer and former Google executive, and David Ebersman, chief financial officer, would be more a tactical move than a statement of disdain, according to a person with knowledge of the preparations.
2012/4/28@While Silicon Valley has benefited from Google and now Facebook in shifting the power dynamic between the two sides, smaller companies are unlikely to be so successful, counters Roger McNamee, a tech investor and founder of Elevation Partners, the $1.9bn fund.
2012/4/28@People briefed on the decision also said that Nasdaq had compelling marketing opportunities equal to the bell-ringing ceremony at NYSE, including Nasdaq's Times Square advertising space and inclusion of Facebook shares alongside Apple and Google in the widely-followed Nasdaq 100 stock index.
2012/4/28@The rise of companies such as Google and Facebook makes it easy to record behaviour around the world.
2012/4/28@The rise of companies such as Google and Facebook makes it easy to record behaviour around the world, and most of what western consumers or companies do today creates electronic or paper trails which armies of economists, analysts and lawyers are paid to measure, record and organise.
2012/4/3@Motorola Mobility, the Google takeover target, has sued Microsoft in Germany for infringement of a patent related to video technology used in Windows 7, Media Player and the Xbox.
2012/4/3@Microsoft and Apple have asked the European Commission to intervene in disputes with Motorola Mobility, which Google has agreed to acquire for $12.5bn.
2012/4/3@"Facebook and Google are now the clear leaders in display advertising," he added.
2012/4/30@Google and PayPal have sounded the alarm in Brussels over a proposed joint venture between Britain's biggest cellphone operators, warning it could choke the fast-developing mobile payments market.
2012/4/30@US tech groups such as Google Wallet, PayPal and IBM fear the market could be grabbed by rivals controlling a key microchip.
2012/4/30@Tech groups are rushing to launch their own rival payment platforms , such as Google Wallet, expected in Europe this year, in a race to win the advantage in establishing a new payment method for consumers.
2012/4/30@FCC report marks low for Google
2012/4/30@The lone engineer who was blamed by Google for its most controversial breach of online privacy told others in the company far more about the affair than Google has previously disclosed, according to the results of a damning US regulatory investigation released over the weekend.
2012/4/30@These include claims from Google engineers that they were free to add code to a project without supervision if they thought they "could improve it", a failure to follow through on a recommendation to have the privacy matter screened by one of the company's in-house lawyers, and the pre-approval by a senior manager of a document before it was even written.
2012/4/30@Google did not respond to the specific findings of the FCC's report.
2012/4/30@The FCC report marks a new low point for Google in what has become the worst apparent contravention yet to be uncovered of its own stated privacy practices.
2012/4/30@Cars equipped to photograph streets for the company's Street View service also collected snippets of personal data from the WiFi networks of a large number of homes they were passing - a fact that Google at first denied, before regulators proved it wrong.
2012/4/30@He called for Congress to interrogate both Google and regulators over the matter, adding: "Why didn't officials blow the whistle on this data cover-up?
2012/4/30@A redacted version of the FCC's report, with the most damning conclusions blacked out, was released by the FCC two weeks ago, and Google said it had acted voluntarily to release the full report.
2012/4/30@Google has 20 per cent.
2012/4/30@People say: you remember the Google idea?
2012/4/4@Take a recent example: a few weeks ago, Google was granted a patent that would potentially allow it to use our phones to study the environment around us - to record noise levels, lighting conditions, temperature - and customise adverts accordingly.
2012/4/4@It's easy to imagine that the folks at intelligence agencies would be quite delighted if Google developed this idea - at the very least, it would save them money on wiretaps.
2012/4/4@Google has an interest in keeping some of its stored data unencrypted.
2012/4/4@If so, the police and intelligence agencies don't need to install GPS trackers on suspects' cars; Google would have us record all of this information voluntarily.
2012/4/4@Yahoo's attack, which was seen as part of an effort by Scott Thompson, chief executive, to boost revenues at the struggling company, echoed a similar assault made against Google in the run-up to that company's initial public offering eight years ago.
2012/4/4@However, while Google quickly agreed a settlement with Yahoo to head off any complications to its IPO, Facebook, which is planning its own Wall Street debut for next month, has dug in.
2012/4/4@It is still unclear whether the data would be gathered by the internet service providers on their networks, or whether the law would require social networking companies such as Google and Facebook to collect and hand over the data.
2012/4/4@Gmail messages are encrypted, which means that the government would be able to see only that a user had visited the Google site, and it is not clear how they would get records of Skype calls without asking Microsoft to hand over logs of calls.
2012/4/5@That is the phrase used by Lise Buyer, an IPO expert who worked at Google at the time of its Wall Street debut and now advises other young companies.
2012/4/5@To kick-start its foreign expansion, Gree last year paid $104m for OpenFeint, a US social gaming platform for Google Android and Apple phones.
2012/4/5@After adjusting for the outsourcing of its search business to Microsoft in late 2010, Yahoo's revenues are barely changed from their level of 2006, a period in which Google and more recently, Facebook have experienced rapid growth.
2012/4/7@HTC, which is ranked fifth in the global smartphone market, began selling phones under its own brand name in 2006, but only garnered attention after it made the first Google Android phone in 2008.
2012/4/7@Although they are allowed to refuse further excavation in listed buildings, the garden is still fair game, and some holes are so big they can be seen on Google Earth.
2012/4/7@It has been described as somewhere between Google TV, with its emphasis on searching the entire web for video, and the "closed" set-top boxes offered by Virgin Media and British Sky Broadcasting.
2012/4/7@I run a small business and rely heavily on a listing on Google Places for new business.
2012/4/7@The information on Google Places - a free service - is about your business, but if the data are held by a third party and not owned by you, it is unlikely your insurer will pay out.
2012/4/7@This issue is not uncommon and, ideally, Google should improve its security measures, but a large number of businesses also fail to register their Google Places account, leaving them open to hijacking, with obvious implications.
2012/4/7@If you fall into that category, the Information Commissioners' Office may be able to assist, but otherwise you'll have to talk to Google and wait four to six weeks.
2012/4/7@After all, an apparently declining US has given us the wonders of Google and Facebook, outstanding medical research, brilliant satellite technology.
2012/4/7@Google and Wikipedia provided me with information about his calculating machines, the difference engine, which was never finished in his lifetime because - as is the case with the fictitious machine designed by Albert Cruikshank - the British government funding was discontinued.
2012/4/7@A trade association representing companies including Facebook and Google has mounted a legal challenge.
2012/4/7@However, that was not enough to put the company back on a path to growth or win back ground lost to Facebook and Google in recent years.
2012/4/9@Normally, I'd Google it but that is off limits.
2012/8/1@Microsoft describes Outlook.com as "modern email" with a "fresh and intuitive design", while AOL last week revamped its webmail interface and Google acquired the design-conscious Sparrow email application in July to improve its Gmail product.
2012/8/10@In early 2010, Google asked Taiwan's HTC to develop the Nexus One, a flagship phone meant to show off the then relatively new Android mobile operating system.
2012/8/10@It was the first of a series of collaborations between Google and hardware makers, from Chromebook laptops to the latest Nexus 7 tablet, made by Asus, writes Sarah Mishkin in Taipei .
2012/8/10@Google set up an online retail store to sell the Nexus, only to close it a few months after its launch.
2012/8/10@For HTC, making the Google phone raised its profile.
2012/8/10@But there are worries among hardware makers that instead of such partnerships, software makers such as Google or Microsoft are increasingly looking to compete with device makers directly.
2012/8/10@"I ultimately believe that if Google really does decide to get into the hardware business itself, that will come through the Motorola brand," says Tim Bajarin, an industry consultant with Creative Strategies.
2012/8/10@Making their own devices is key for the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft,
2012/8/10@Their brands may look more familiar on a website or a software package, but the names and logos of Amazon, Google and Microsoft are appearing increasingly on hardware as they pursue their mobile ambitions.
2012/8/10@By contrast, Microsoft, together with Intel, extracted a large chunk of the industry's profits by ruling over a "horizontal" PC world - they provided the software and the chips that powered the open platform of the web, where Google and Amazon built their businesses.
2012/8/10@Google makes its money from the sheer number of people that are using search and its other services, so if that's being limited by the hardware that consumers can use, it limits its revenue opportunity.

2012/8/14@Google said severance costs would be no more than $275m, to be recognised in the third quarter.
2012/8/14@While Google's Android operating system is already widely used on smartphones made by companies including Samsung and HTC, owning its own handset manufacturing company is expected to give Google a deeper insight into how mobile customers behave.

2012/8/2@While Google has failed to match Facebook's social network effects with its faltering Google+ platform, it is seeking to apply its strength in advertising analytics to measure the effectiveness of social ads, an area where Facebook has struggled to keep up with the demands of advertisers.

2012/8/9@Google is launching a challenge to Apple   with a voice-enabled search app for the iPhone that will compete directly with the Siri personal assistant.
2012/8/9@In a sign of the increasing competition between Silicon Valley groups, some of the features of the Google app go beyond the capabilities of Siri, pre-empting Apple's upgrade in the forthcoming iOS 6 operating system for the iPhone and iPad.

2012/12/10@Founder Gil Elbaz, another former Google executive, forecasts that a small number of companies such as his will end up becoming the "canonical" sources of digital information on which the big data world turns.
2012/12/10@The news comes only days after Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer by sales, and Google also announced the launch of e-commerce operations in the country.
2012/12/10@Our investment in Google this year will be over $2bn versus $1.6bn last year, so it's showing considerable growth.
2012/12/10@So it is growing, but not as rapidly as Google and the reason is simple - Google has got its feet planted in multi-sectors whereas Facebook is still really purely a social network and hasn't developed the mobile answer that you were referring to.
2012/12/10@The two big issues for Google I think are size - as you grow bigger can you cope with it - and regulation.

2012/12/10@Companies such as Google and Facebook are in bidding wars over such candidates.
2012/12/11@But in higher-margin web services and electronic media, it competes with aggressive and deep-pocketed companies that have staked their futures on media and cloud services: Apple, Google and Microsoft.
2012/12/11@With software developers switching their attention to the new Apple and Google mobile software platforms, RIM now faces an uphill battle in putting itself back at the centre of the mobile technology ecosystem.
2012/12/12@Moreover it has no authority over communications information held by foreign companies such as Google or Facebook, which currently only yield data when they choose.
2012/12/12@The problems that arise in attributing its profits to jurisdictions are essentially the same as the problems encountered in attributing to particular jurisdictions the profits of Google or Vodafone, of banks and pharmaceuticals groups, and of most other companies whose low tax payments are controversial.

2012/12/17@In contrast, most analysts expect a strong fiscal fourth quarter for RIM bolstered by the sale of about 1.5m BB10 devices and strong demand from network operators that want an alternative to Apple iOS and Google Android-based handsets.
2012/12/17@Mr Bernabè, calling for regulators to reconsider their stance, joined other supporters of the treaty in suggesting that the US was using the principle of freedom as a cover to protect companies such as Google and Facebook from attempts to co-ordinate regulation.
2012/12/17@There could not be a European Google or a European Facebook because it would be so complex to comply with rules and the obligations of European privacy laws.
2012/12/17@Mr Bernabè takes issue with the amount of personal information that passes through US organisations such as Walmart, Google and Facebook.
2012/12/18@Date set for gloves to come off in Google v Germany
2012/12/18@Google and German newspaper publishers will be able to trade blows at a parliamentary hearing at the end of January over plans to allow Germany's print media to charge internet search engines for displaying links to newspaper articles.
2012/12/18@Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and their Free Democrat junior partners want to force online news aggregators like Google to ask permission to publish links to and excerpts of newspapers' web offerings - an extension of copyright that many lawmakers hope will allow publishers to charge licence fees of Google and its rivals.
2012/12/18@So worried is Google about the bill before the Bundestag that it has launched a campaign warning it could end easy access to information on the web and calling for Google users to phone or email their local member of parliament in protest.
2012/12/18@The company hopes that Germans opposed to legislation will draw strength from an agreement between Google and Frenchlanguage publishers in Belgium last week.
2012/12/18@The publishers association Copiepresse withdrew a six-year legal campaign that accused Google's news service of breaching newspapers' copyright in return for an initiative to push more Google users on to their websites.
2012/12/18@In an October meeting with Eric Schmidt, Google chairman, President François Hollande threatened to draft legislation forcing Google to pay a share of its revenues derived from links to articles if it did not reach a deal to do so with French publishers by year's end.
2012/12/18@Google says the campaign "Protect your web - find what you're looking for" is a success.
2012/12/18@Philipp Rösler, economy minister, warned Google "to watch for the difference between protecting one's interests and misleading the public".
2012/12/18@Other big technology groups enjoyed solid gains, with Google rising 2.7 per cent to $720.99 and Microsoft adding 1.1 per cent to $27.09.

2012/12/19@Google close to EU antitrust settlement;
2012/12/19@Google is edging closer to a settlement with the EU's top competition authority after Brussels said the US search engine had made substantial progress in addressing concerns for allegedly abusing its market dominance.
2012/12/19@Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, said Google would have to send a final proposal by the end of January to resolve all concerns but people familiar with the matter said an agreement was very close.
2012/12/19@"Since our preliminary talks with Google started in July, we have substantially reduced our differences regarding possible ways to address each of the four competition concerns expressed by the commission," Mr Almunia said yesterday at the end of a meeting with Eric Schmidt, Google chairman.
2012/12/19@While a deal has yet to be finalised, the latest meeting has helped to reassure Mr Almunia that Google is taking his concerns seriously.
2012/12/19@The swift progress of the talks could also save Google from the sort of decade-long fight that Microsoft and Intel endured in Brussels.
2012/12/19@Brussels is concerned that Google gives undue prominence to its own services, such as maps and comparison shopping, harming competition and consumer choice.
2012/12/19@The European Commission has also complained that Google discriminates against some sites by relegating them in its rankings; shuts out competition with its advertising agreements with other websites; and restricts advertisers from moving their online ad campaigns to rival search engines.
2012/12/19@Google said it would continue to work closely with the EU's executive arm, without giving further details.
2012/12/19@In July, Google offered a series of significant changes to its business model.

2012/12/19@The latest upset follows series of controversies as internet companies such as Facebook and Google impose new terms and conditions on their users as they seek new ways to make money from their content.
2012/12/20@Although some big companies such as Google manage to keep a sense of fun , the goofing-off strategy may work better for small businesses with young staff.
2012/12/20@Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corp, patent holding and licensing companies that count Apple and Google among their clients, have led the proposed deal.
2012/12/20@Google lost out in an auction for Nortel's patents to an Apple-led consortium last year.

2012/12/21@Rivals such as Samsung and Google are catching up in the smartphone and tablet businesses it pioneered.
2012/12/21@Apple's share-price peak on September 19 happens to have coincided with the release of iOS 6, the update to its iPhone operating system that replaced the popular Google Maps with an inferior mapping application of its own.
2012/12/21@One app-market researcher, Distimo, estimates that on a typical day, consumer spending on the App Store is $15m, more than four times as much as Google Play, its marketplace for Android devices - despite the iPhone's much smaller share of the handset market.
2012/12/21@But the App Store's success rests in selling third-party software, much of which is now available on Google and Amazon's platforms.
2012/12/21@Patrick Gibson, an independent app developer and former iPad engineer, touched a nerve among Apple watchers with a blog post observation that Google was moving faster.
2012/12/22@In the US, the Federal Trade Commission came close to ending a similar investigation into Google over injunctions by its Motorola division.
2012/12/22@Google was set to drop them as part of its resolution of a broader antitrust inquiry, though the expected announcement was postponed at the last minute.
2012/12/22@With Apple and Microsoft already promising not to seek bans against rival products where standards-essential patents are concerned, the moves against Samsung and Google promised to take some of the heat out of the legal battles.
2012/12/24@A Google search produces 1.2m results.
2012/12/24@Google should not be choosing right and wrong
2012/12/24@The Irishman would have been a fan of Google Now , the web company's rival to Siri, Apple's snarky voice-activated virtual personal assistant.
2012/12/24@Google Now is less chatty than Siri.
2012/12/24@It pre-empts your questions by analysing what Google already knows about you.
2012/12/24@Available on Android phones, Google Now might soon also be coming to our browsers.
2012/12/24@Since your reservation is in your Google-run inbox or your Google-run calendar, Google Now would show a reminder, tell you what weather to expect on arrival and map the best route to the airport, checking traffic conditions beforehand.
2012/12/24@This is all possible because Google can anticipate your information needs.
2012/12/24@Google doesn't need to guess your politics to notice that you drive to the airport on Mondays.
2012/12/24@But the latest version of Google Now also generates a very different reminder.
2012/12/24@At the end of each month, Google happily reports - without you ever asking for it!
2012/12/24@Here Google assumes that walking is more important - perhaps, even more moral - than, say, driving.
2012/12/24@With Google at the helm, however, resistance is minimal.
2012/12/24@We don't mind our phones spying on us - at least not when Google needs this data to tell us about flight delays.
2012/12/24@And as Google begins to mediate our interactions with the built environment - through its self-driving cars, smart glasses, smartphones - the scope for "algorithmic nudging" also expands.
2012/12/24@Google doesn't hide its aims.
2012/12/24@Google could be his natural ally.
2012/12/24@The moment you walk in, Google already knows if you've met your calorie target for the day.
2012/12/24@As befits a corporation, Google treats us as utility-maximising consumers and not as citizens, who might care about other members of the community.
2012/12/27@In 2009 the 100 most popular sites - ranging from Google to CNN.com - used a total of more than 3,500 cookies to track visitors to their sites.
2012/12/27@The Colorado-based group - which helps clients bid for "paid search" results on search engines such as Yahoo, Google and, increasingly, Facebook - will use the funds to aid the group's expansion into Europe, Latin America and Asia.
2012/12/27@Paid-search on Facebook has also grown in recent years, although traditional search engines such as Yahoo, Bing and Google account for the bulk of DGS's revenues.
2012/12/28@The app store on Google smartphones , where users can download games and software, was a key area in which Android smartphones have trailed behind the iPhone.
2012/12/28@Apple vets the apps in its store whereas Google does not review any apps before making them available, giving developers more freedom but increasing the risks for users.
2012/12/28@However, the search company has made greater efforts to help users find the best software, as well as selling films, books and music through Google Play.
2012/12/28@In September, Google said 25bn apps had been downloaded to Android devices, a milestone Apple reached the previous March .
2012/12/28@What Google does is supply products to meet a demand
2012/12/28@Sir, Evgeny Morozov maintains that, if government knew as much about us as Google does, we would be very worried ("Google should not be choosing right and wrong", Comment, December 24).
2012/12/28@We supply information to Google "for our own good" in a rather different sense: all that information is given voluntarily, by individuals who judge this to be in their best interest.
2012/12/28@Sir, I had never heard of Evgeny Morozov, the author of "Google should not be choosing right and wrong" (December 24), but 1,250,000 results on Google dispelled my ignorance.
2012/12/29@"That's Facebook and Google because they are going to make me the largest digital network in the world, which is my goal.
2012/12/3@MPs described evidence from Starbucks, Amazon, Google and HMRC as "unconvincing and in some cases evasive".
2012/12/3@The MPs described the evidence it heard from Starbucks, Amazon and Google - and that of HM Revenue & Customs officials - as "unconvincing".
2012/12/3@So, with the help of Mr Lonsdale and backing from Google Ventures among others, Mr Carter created Backplane, a new social media platform on which sits Littlemonsters.com.
2012/12/31@Sprint helped form Clearwire, a wireless broadband network operator, in 2008 with the support of a group of technology companies, including Google and Intel, and leading US cable TV operators, including Comcast and Time Warner.
2012/12/31@As individual taxes rise and public services are cut, public tolerance of fiscal arbitrage by multinationals such as Starbucks, Google and eBay is wearing thin.
2012/12/4@"Ownership of the consumer is key - as media, cable and telecoms companies move from triple play to quad play services, they increasingly need to respond to consumer desire for integrated software and hardware solutions offered by the likes of Apple, Google and Microsoft.
2012/12/4@Amazon, Google and Starbucks have operated on this basis in many countries, including Britain.
2012/12/4@Google
2012/12/4@What it did Google recorded revenues of £396m in 2011, paying corporation tax of only £6m.
2012/12/4@The defence Google plays by the rules, which politicians should change if they do not like them.
2012/12/4@The flow of profits from traditional business in media and telecoms to Silicon Valley start-ups that have spawned dotcom heroes such as Google and Apple has also meant that the power increasingly lies away from these once-mighty converged models of content and distribution.
2012/12/4@Indeed, the next level of convergence would appear to be outside TMT, in markets such as financial services, given a race between the large telecoms groups and technology companies such as Google and Apple to launch "mobile wallets" that can offer financial services across mobile devices.
2012/12/5@Though some large data centre operators, including Google and Facebook, have moved their sites to less populated areas of the US, such as Arizona and Oregon, the reliability of power is often more important than its price.
2012/12/5@Karim Faris, general partner at Google Ventures, says: "Trying to convince the Fortune 500 to go 100 per cent cloud is a tall order.
2012/12/5@Recognising this, Google Ventures has invested in a number of Silicon Valley start-ups that provide what Mr Faris calls bridge technology.
2012/12/5@"We get compared to Google or Amazon or Starbucks," he says.

2012/2/10@Google plans deeper push on home entertainment
2012/2/10@Google is laying the groundwork for a deeper move into home entertainment that could see it launch its own hardware device, a move that would add a new twist to its intensifying competition with Apple.
2012/2/10@While it has not disclosed further details, the outline hints at the development of a home entertainment hub with the ability to stream content between devices and suggests that Google is seeking to grab a central position in digital home entertainment.
2012/2/10@In another sign of its widening ambitions in hardware, Google confirmed earlier this week that it had hired the top product quality engineer from Apple, bringing it a leading expert in high-volume manufacturing of consumer devices.
2012/2/10@Simon Prakash, a nine-year Apple veteran, had held the title of senior director of product integrity, although Google did not disclose what his new job would entail.
2012/2/10@News of the device testing and senior hire comes as Google is close to a deeper move into hardware with its pending acquisition of Motorola Mobility.
2012/2/10@While it has said that the acquisition was mounted mainly to acquire Motorola's extensive portfolio of patents, helping it to defend its Android mobile system against legal attacks from rivals, the deal will also put Google directly into the handset and TV set-top box business.
2012/2/10@Until now, Google has worked with other hardware makers to further its ambitions in digital entertainment, for instance with the launch last year of its Google TV software to bring its services to TV sets.

2012/2/14@Google has won approval from Brussels for the $12.5bn purchase of Motorola Mobility,  writes Stanley Pignal .
2012/2/14@The takeover of the US smartphone maker, announced in August , had partly hinged on regulators' concerns about how Google would use Motorola's 17,000-strong patent portfolio.
2012/2/14@The green light will give Google the means to compete head-to-head with Apple in the lucrative smartphone market.
2012/2/14@Google owns the popular Android operating system but has so far not manufactured its own devices, preferring to make its software available to third parties - which is not expected to change with its Motorola purchase.
2012/2/14@Google changes focus on dealmaking
2012/2/14@Google has narrowed the focus of its corporate acquisitions to a few big strategic areas, according to the man in charge of overseeing one of the tech industry's largest M&A programmes.
2012/2/14@As a result, Google had now largely focused its acquisitions in new markets such as video and mobile, said David Lawee, head of corporate development, in a rare interview.
2012/2/14@Mr Lawee is in charge of an acquisition programme that has seen Google make 120 deals in its history.
2012/2/14@While Google will not discuss the amount it expects to spend, its firepower has risen.
2012/2/14@Formerly Google used deals to try out potential new markets, echoing the "20 per cent time" that its engineers used to develop their own pet projects.
2012/2/14@A recent spring cleaning under Mr Page has seen Google close several less strategic services acquired in recent years.
2012/2/14@He brushed off concerns that Google was at risk of overpaying as the valuations of internet start-ups rise sharply and competition builds from cash-rich competitors.
2012/2/14@In another indication of the change of approach under Mr Page, Mr Lawee said a more entrepreneurial style had taken hold at Google that was likely to match the style of people it hoped to lure to the company.
2012/2/14@Google shifts its dealmaking focus

2012/2/14@The doubts were not strong enough for Washington or Brussels to oppose the deal, which Google said was needed to strengthen its weak legal position amid the smartphone industry's patent wars.
2012/2/14@Google agreed to buy Motorola , which has 17,000 patents, last August, while Apple bid $2bn for patents from Nortel, making it the largest buyer alongside Microsoft and Research In Motion after an auction that totalled $4.5bn.
2012/2/14@The justice department said it was worried about how Google might seek to enforce the patent rights acquired from Motorola.
2012/2/14@The DoJ's unease over Google was made all the more stark by its support for undertakings that Apple and Microsoft have given not to enforce their patents that are used in industry standards by trying to block products made by rivals.
2012/2/14@By contrast, it called the commitments that Google gave to standards bodies last week "more ambiguous", since they did not include the same promise not to seek injunctions.
2012/2/14@The doubts were not strong enough for Washington or Brussels to try to stand in the way of the deal, and both approved a purchase that Google has said is needed to strengthen its weak legal position amid the smartphone industry's patent wars.
2012/2/15@Young start-ups greatly reduce stock awards for new hires once their success seems assured - as Google did in 2002.
2012/2/15@Amazon is an established player and Microsoft, IBM and Google are all pushing in.
2012/2/16@It wants the EU to push for open video-conferencing standards that would allow its own users to call contacts on Skype or other platforms such as Google Talk.
2012/2/16@That beats both Google and Yahoo, each with about 12 per cent.
2012/2/16@Yet Facebook still lags far behind Google when it comes to overall online ad revenues, taking an expected 8 per cent this year, compared with Google's 45 per cent, including search.
2012/2/16@In 2004, when Google was about to make its stock market debut, it had a reputation for trying to circumvent agencies and talk directly with clients.
2012/2/16@Google has long since reversed that tactic as it chases a bigger slice of the media budgets agencies control, and is now seen as the "gold standard" among technology companies in their relationship with agencies, says Mr Jones.
2012/2/16@Google and Apple lower ad costs
2012/2/16@Google and Apple have both lowered the minimum price for mobile advertising in an attempt to encourage more marketers and application developers to use their technologies, ahead of Facebook and LinkedIn's expected entries to the market .
2012/2/16@To counter these issues, Google and Apple, as well as some independent mobile ad networks, are lowering their prices to lure more first-time advertisers on to the platform, hoping the incentive will lift overall volumes.
2012/2/16@Yesterday, Google rem-oved the 10 cent minimum bid and targeting fees for "cost per click" ads on its AdMob platform.
2012/2/16@Google must remember our right to be forgotten
2012/2/16@But as Google's policy makes clear, even though the school retains ownership of the students' content and may demand its deletion, Google intends to integrate data derived  from students' school activities with data from any of its other digital services - and use this to make money.
2012/2/16@Picasa has a tagging feature that can tell Google where and when photographs were taken, and an advanced facial recognition feature that allows Google to identify individuals it has seen in one photo in any photo in the user's digital library.
2012/2/16@Integrating just these three services with Google's core search function could allow Google to locate individuals in virtually any digital photograph on the internet, and so derive where each user has been, when, with whom and doing what.
2012/2/16@Add YouTube to the mix, or Android smartphones, or whatever other database Google develops or buys - the implications are breathtaking.
2012/2/16@Companies that depend on monetising user data, such as Google and Facebook, would be badly hit.
2012/2/18@The market leader has become even more dominant since Google moved its Chinese web search from its mainland China site to Hong Kong in 2010 after a standoff with the Chinese government over hacking and censorship.
2012/2/18@Google defensive after fresh privacy breach;
2012/2/18@Google was scrambling yesterday to give internet users more power to block advertisers from tracking their online behaviour as it sought to limit the damage from the latest privacy scandal to dent its corporate image.
2012/2/18@Google had circumvented the default setting in Safari that is meant to prevent advertisers from planting "cookies" in the browser, according to Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student at the university.
2012/2/18@"We didn't anticipate that this would happen, and we have now started removing these advertising cookies from Safari browsers," Google said in a statement.
2012/2/18@That made the repeat failure "astounding", particularly since Google had also made commitments about improving its performance as part of a recent privacy settlement with US regulators, he added.
2012/2/18@Google is now racing to include the "do not track" technology in its Chrome browser but will go further than other companies by abiding by the requests in its ad network, according to the person familiar with its plans.

2012/2/18@I suggest you Google it and find out.
2012/2/18@Apple, Google and other technology groups are expected to make submissions, and the reviews could become a test case to find out which regulators trust the least - music companies or tech giants.
2012/2/20@Microsoft and Google among rivals
2012/2/22@Google Places has advantage in searches, says TripAdvisor
2012/2/22@Google is getting more aggressive in prioritising its own services in search results at the expense of independent sites, according to a senior TripAdvisor executive, even since the search engine group has come under closer regulatory scrutiny following allegations of anticompetitive behaviour.
2012/2/22@"We continue to see them putting Google Places results higher in the search results - higher on the page than other natural search results," said Adam Medros, TripAdvisor's vice-president for product, referring to Google's local reviews and listings service which competes with TripAdvisor's hotel and restaurant reviews site.
2012/2/22@"What we are constantly vigilant about is that Google treats relevant content fairly.
2012/2/22@TripAdvisor had previously clashed with Google over its incorporation of extracts from reviews into Places, without its consent.
2012/2/22@In July last year, Google ceased using such snippets after complaints from other listings services such as Yelp, a move seen at the time as the first indication that Google was responding to regulators' pressure.
2012/2/22@This prompted complaints by rival social media sites such as Twitter, in what critics say is one of several examples of Google promoting in-house "vertical" services to the detriment of both users and competitors.
2012/2/22@The European Union began its investigation into whether Google is abusing its dominant position in the search market more than a year ago but in the intervening period, its use of search to promote other products has only increased, Mr Medros told the Financial Times.
2012/2/22@"I would say if you looked at a screen shot of Google today and Google a year ago, there are definitely more Google-owned products 'above the fold' on the page than there were a year ago," Mr Medros said.
2012/2/22@Allegations of bundling or "tying" related services have become central to competition watchdogs' investigations into Google .
2012/2/22@Mr Medros emphasised that TripAdvisor works well with Google in other areas, such as its Android smartphone system where the reviews site has a popular app.
2012/2/22@Google is relying on the statistical analysis of our previous searches to make future searches more accurate.
2012/2/23@Microsoft in fresh attack on Google
2012/2/23@Microsoft opened a fresh front in its legal battle with Google, lodging a complaint with Europe's competition watchdog over Motorola Mobility, the smartphone maker and Google takeover target , alleging it is shutting out rivals through aggressive patent enforcement.
2012/2/23@Google brushed off the allegations, saying: "We haven't seen Microsoft's complaint but it's consistent with the way they use the regulatory process to attack competitors.
2012/2/23@After the Google merger decision, Joaquín Almunia, competition commissioner, said he would "continue to keep a close eye on the behaviour of all market players in the sector, particularly the increasingly strategic use of patents".

2012/2/6@Google had a 52 per cent share of the US mobile ad market in 2011, according to analysts at Emarketer, compared with just 6.4 per cent for Apple, its nearest rival.
2012/2/6@Searches on mobile devices where Google can show ads doubled during last year, as it introduced new ad formats such as allowing users to "click to call" local businesses.
2012/2/6@But even Google is struggling with its inability to charge as much for mobile search ads as it does on the desktop web, a discrepancy which contributed to an 8 per cent decline in the company's overall cost-per-click rates in the fourth quarter of last year.

2012/2/9@Google in patent push to win Motorola approval
2012/2/9@Google will make a public declaration on how it intends to use Motorola Mobility's arsenal of patents in an attempt to clear the path for Europe's competition watchdog to approve its $12.5bn takeover of the US smartphone maker .
2012/2/9@Yielding to pressure from the European Commission, Google will reiterate Motorola's existing commitments to license any patents that are part of industry-wide technology standards to all applicants on a fair and reasonable basis.
2012/2/9@The gesture of good faith will also outline in more detail a ceiling for patent royalties and the steps that would be taken to resolve disputes before Google would resort to court injunctions seeking to ban a product from being sold.
2012/2/9@The letters, which will be sent to standard setting bodies, mostly restate what lawyers see as legal obligations that Google would inherit from Motorola.
2012/2/9@Brussels last week opened an investigation against Samsung Electronics over concerns that it breached antitrust rules blocking rivals access to key technologies - a case raising issues that are seen as having some parallels with the Google merger.
2012/2/9@The deal gives Google direct access to Motorola Mobility's portfolio of 17,000 patents and 7,500 pending patents, ammunition Google claims it needs to repel a patent assault by Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others on its Android mobile phone operating system.
2012/2/9@During negotiations with competition officials, Google was nevertheless asked about the risk that these patents could be used in an aggressive manner that would inhibit competition.
2012/2/9@A wider aim of the Commission is to better define the fair and reasonable terms for licensing patents, a process that would be assisted by Google providing greater clarity on the use of injunctions or royalties.
2012/2/9@While Google did not submit any legally binding concessions - so-called "remedies" - to address specific competition concerns, a statement of intent on the use of patents would be taken into account in the approval decision.
2012/2/9@Google said the company always intended to license Motorola's standard-essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
2012/2/9@That Google would have a job for the top product quality engineer from Apple's high-volume global supply chain offers a tantalising glimpse into its plans.
2012/2/9@One obvious conclusion is that, with its acquisition of Motorola Mobility pending, Google is bringing in some extra expertise to fill a gap.
2012/2/9@But with Apple at the top of its game, a hire like this shows Google is aiming very high and probably had more in its sights than Motorola's patents.
2012/2/9@With Microsoft's tablet-ready Windows 8 in the offing, Google needs to move fast.
2012/2/9@Google is not in a position to set the rules for the game that is developing.

2012/1/11@By including more personal and social information in its results, the new feature also takes Google a step closer to achieving a long-held dream.
2012/1/11@Known as Search, plus Your World, the move marks the most direct attempt yet by Google to use its core service to help it make up lost ground in social networking.
2012/1/11@Google said it would "certainly be open" to including other services, but justified the current exclusion because it "does not have access to crawl all the information on some sites".
2012/1/11@With the new feature, content shared privately with contacts on Google+ will be included in search results, although Google said it would ensure it kept the same levels of privacy as applied on Google+.

2012/1/12@Google and Twitter have become embroiled in a war of words over the search engine's new "your world" update that draws information from its Google+ social network directly into users' search results, and has raised concerns that it would over-emphasise Google's own social network ahead of rivals.
2012/1/12@The row comes after negotiations broke down last summer to renew a contract that allowed Google to index Twitter's constant flow of hundreds of millions of daily tweets.
2012/1/12@As it competes with Twitter and Facebook for consumer attention and, increasingly, advertising dollars, Google has attempted to incorporate more social networking "signals" in its search results, creating a more personalised experience for every user.
2012/1/12@As it launched the "search plus your world" update, Google also said that certain queries would return results featuring "prominent people who frequently discuss this topic on Google+" at the top right of its page, where it usually shows paid advertisements or sometimes Google features such as maps.
2012/1/12@Google responded using its official Google+ account to say it was "surprised by Twitter's comments about Search plus Your World, because they chose not to renew their agreement with us last summer".
2012/1/12@Since then, Google has been unable to index tweets with links in them.
2012/1/12@Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman, told the Marketing Land news site that Google was still open to conversations with Twitter and Facebook and denied that the new search results favoured Google+.

2012/1/17@Twitter has carefully avoided being drawn into a row with Google about antitrust issues, limiting itself to accusing the company of giving up its ethical high ground by risking the quality of its search results.
2012/1/17@One person close to Twitter's board said that the company had been caught in the middle of a fight between Google and Facebook, at whom the "Your World" feature was mainly aimed, but that the company's position would not be helped by getting into a regulatory fight.
2012/1/17@Another person close to the situation contrasted Twitter's stance to that of other companies, which have been more direct in challenging Google on antitrust grounds, including taking their cases to Washington.
2012/1/17@Technology companies, however, contend that such measures would stifle innovation, and hold companies such as Google and Facebook liable for links and content that they cannot easily control.

2012/1/20@Google shares hit as results fall short
2012/1/20@Google shocked Wall Street yesterday with a big shortfall in its latest earnings, as an unexpected slump in pricing in its core search advertising business combined with slowing growth internationally and another jump in costs to dent recent optimism about the company's prospects.
2012/1/20@That included further growth in display advertising, which he said had lifted revenues to an annualised $5bn, or double the level Google reported for that business 15 months ago.
2012/1/20@The decline was partly made up by a stronger than expected jump in the number of clicks recorded, which rose 34 per cent from a year before, and Google executives argued that changes in cost-per-click should not be viewed in isolation.

2012/1/21@Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft's gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.
2012/1/21@Google kept IBM, Microsoft and Intel out of the headlines by missing expectations .

2012/1/24@After last week's shutdown of Megaupload , the file sharing site which the US Department of Justice alleges cost the entertainment industry hundreds of millions of dollars in sales lost to illegal downloading, music company executives hope that other websites - including Google - will do more to prevent piracy on their networks.
2012/1/24@Rather than adopt Google Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems like many of its competitors have done, RIM is gambling that by maintaining control over BB10, it will be able to differentiate its products, and avoid the price competition now affecting some Android users.
2012/1/24@Google and Motorola
2012/1/24@When Google announced its attention to buy mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility last August, it looked like a weird idea.
2012/1/24@Google generated $38bn in sales at a 37 per cent operating margin last year.
2012/1/24@If things do not improve at Motorola the merger will leave Google with $12bn in additional sales and margins nearly 10 percentage points lower.
2012/1/24@Hence the speculation that Google will use Motorola as part of a proper hardware strategy.
2012/1/24@Google is of course eager to keep its other partners happy, but it should keep its options open with Motorola.
2012/1/24@Last week's defeat of proposed legislation to combat online piracy was a victory for the technology companies such as Google and Facebook that argued the bill would stifle innovation.
2012/1/24@But despite having outspent the technology industry on lobbying on the issue, the media industry was swiftly outflanked by a loosely organised coalition that included Wikipedia, Google and thousands of internet users.

2012/1/24@Jillian York, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, also said Google had gone much further than Facebook in trying to deal with the human rights concerns raised by its identity policies, though she added that some users who tried to disguise their names while setting up accounts might still encounter problems with the process.

2012/1/25@Google overhauls privacy policies
2012/1/25@Google paved the way yesterday for the introduction of more personalised services and advertising online, as it disclosed an overhaul of privacy policies and terms of service that cover many of its products.
2012/1/25@Under its new policies, Google said that it would be freer to deploy its users' personal information across a wider range of services, bringing a more personal experience to everything from search to Gmail.
2012/1/25@The overhaul seemed set to trigger fresh scrutiny from privacy advocates, some of whom have voiced concern about recent Google moves to user personal data gathered in one service to power others.
2012/1/25@The changes would enable it to create more useful experiences, Google said, for instance by using information in a Gmail exchange to create automatic calendar entries about future events, or by using information about a users' location to send automatic alerts about traffic conditions.
2012/1/25@This month, Google prompted questions when it began to use information from its Google+ social network in its search engine results, signalling its most ambitious attempt to gain an edge over rivals by linking two of its main services.
2012/1/25@Google occupies the position that only a decade ago people expected would be occupied by Yahoo and AOL, just as Facebook displaced MySpace.

2012/1/26@12.14pm: Keller says that it is helpful to Google when complainants submit a court order where a judge has ruled that the information online is defamatory and should be removed from Google's search results.
2012/1/26@Keller agrees, adding that it would be impractical for Google to search out potentially defamatory material itself.
2012/1/26@She says Google has a "cache removal rool" and that it is important for the search engine to adhere to requests by webmasters to not index their websites.
2012/1/26@Google has its "ears open everywhere to pick up complaints," Keller says.
2012/1/26@12.05pm: Barr points out that Google has different domains - such as google.co.uk and google.com - and they under different jurisdictions.

2012/7/17@Google has submitted a revised package of concessions to address the concerns of Europe's top competition authority , bringing the talks to settle the EU antitrust investigation to a critical juncture.
2012/7/17@Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, had spoken to Eric Schmidt, Google chairman, and requested the US group clarify some elements of its informal offer submitted two weeks ago.
2012/7/17@The initial Google proposal came after Mr Almunia delivered an ultimatum to the internet search group to change its business practices or face formal antitrust charges, a protracted legal dispute and the threat of multibillion-dollar fines.
2012/7/17@But with the bargaining under way - which Mr Schmidt has described as a "back and forth" with the regulator - indicates Google put enough on the table to make serious follow-up worthwhile.
2012/7/17@Within the next fortnight he will decide whether to serve Google with formal charges or open the next phase of talks to agree technical details of a settlement.
2012/7/17@Both Mr Almunia and Google are keen to reach a speedy deal and avoid a decade of wrangling through the courts.
2012/7/17@Mr Almunia is worried about how Google favours its own products in search results; "copies" content from rivals without permission; shuts out competition with its advertising agreements with other websites; and restricts advertisers from moving their online ad campaigns to rival search engines.
2012/7/17@Should Google refuse to compromise, it faces formal charges that could lead to fines of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, which was about $37.9bn last year.
2012/7/17@Under commission guidelines, Google would then typically be given about a month to finalise its offer, which would then be "tested" with rivals that complained about its behaviour.

2012/7/18@The public rebuke from Mr Almunia will be a big setback for Microsoft, which has more recently cast itself as a complainant seeking Brussels' help to clip the wings of rivals such as Google .
2012/7/18@Marissa Mayer, who worked at Google for her entire 13-year career until this week, was chosen despite strong internal competition from Ross Levinsohn , Yahoo's interim chief since May and the web portal's head of global media.

2012/7/20@Ms Mayer, whose personal fortune after joining Google as its 20th employee is already estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, will receive an annual base salary of $1m, plus a bonus of up to 400 per cent if she exceeds targets, according to SEC filings posted yesterday.
2012/7/20@She gave her notice to Google by telephone on Monday, after 13 years with the search firm, before starting work at Yahoo on Tuesday.
2012/7/21@Google rallied in after-hours trading on Thursday as the internet search group reported a rise in profits for the second quarter.

2012/7/21@Just For Clicks: The Google Ad Model;
2012/7/21@When Hal Varian arrived at Google as a part-time economic adviser in 2002, he asked the then chief executive, Eric Schmidt, how he might make himself useful.
2012/7/21@Schmidt suggested that Varian might "take a look" at the way Google sold its advertising because "it might make us a little money".
2012/7/21@Google decided to auction advertising space instead.
2012/7/21@If you search on Google, one set of Google computers tries to deliver the best possible search results; a second set is running an auction with the aim of delivering the most effective ads to be displayed alongside them, in 11 different positions of varying prominence.
2012/7/21@If I sell flights to Reykjavik and you Google "flights to Iceland", I want one of those ad spaces.
2012/7/21@Google doesn't want to sell slots in parallel because advertisers fear winning multiple redundant slots.
2012/7/21@Google could charge per "impression" - that is, for each time an advertisement is displayed.
2012/7/21@I typed "Picasso prints" into Google and was offered the chance to buy some posters, but also to bid at an auction at Christie's.
2012/7/21@If Christie's is willing to pay $1,000 a click, and Google expects one such click, Art.co.uk will beat them with a bid of 10 cents a click, as long as Google expects more than 10,000 clicks - rightly so, since Google's expected revenue from Art.co.uk is higher.
2012/7/21@The biggest surprise for me is that many Google searches are "undersold", with a few advertisers getting a bargain-basement rate - or no advertisers at all.
2012/7/21@Type "Hal Varian Google ad auctions" into Google and you'll see no ads.
2012/7/21@Type "flowers" into Google and, I assure you, all 11 advertising spaces will be filled.
2012/7/21@It is on such searches that Google earns that $36bn.
2012/7/21@There are people who Google resilience courses and see they are all the rage because resilience is the capacity to tolerate excessive demands and stresses without experiencing any stress-related problems or threats to performance - and who wouldn't want that?
2012/7/21@The data-driven diva who left Google to 'go purple';
2012/7/21@Riding the wave of constant growth at Google may not have adequately prepared her for the difficulties at Yahoo, sceptics say.
2012/7/21@Nonetheless, she is the closest thing Google has had to a celebrity.
2012/7/21@At high school she managed to make both the debating team and dance group - a combination of brains and blonde that would fare her well as the media-friendly face of Google at a time when few of the search engine's geeky guys were interested in talking to the press.
2012/7/21@She joined Google aged 24 after studying computer science at Stanford University, becoming custodian of the homepage as well as other core services such as Gmail.
2012/7/21@But Ms Mayer was seen as being sidelined in her later years at Google and emerges with a mixed reputation as a manager.
2012/7/21@Crucial to her success at Yahoo will be answering what the website, visited by hundreds of millions of people, is really for in an age of Facebook and Google dominance.
2012/7/21@I Google it.
2012/7/21@Microsoft and Google
2012/7/21@Mobile services are the new frontier of the software business, a trend Mr Almunia recognised in the demands he made on Google in tense antitrust settlement talks.
2012/7/21@Mr Almunia will decide next week whether to pursue a settlement or hit Google with formal charges for allegedly abusing its dominant position.
2012/7/21@His 11th-hour demand is that Google extend the concessions it offered to mobile services.
2012/7/21@Should Google decide the terms are too onerous, Mr Almunia would next week start formal antitrust action that could lead to multibillion-dollar fines and a protracted court battle.
2012/7/23@Google TV: Apps and YouTube on a big screen
2012/7/23@Google TV gives users access to thousands of apps, Google search and ever-growing web content including YouTube, all on a big screen.
2012/7/23@The big global tech giants Google and Apple want a slice of the action too.
2012/7/23@Google launched Google TV in Britain last week, aiming to bring the internet experience of Google search and the ever richer array of web content to the TV.
2012/7/23@"The TV space is very much like the smartphone space was five years ago," says Suveer Kothari, head of global distribution for Google TV.
2012/7/24@From Google to Telefónica, Publicis to Nestlé, and Tata to Toyota, the chiefs of the world's largest companies are descending on London.
2012/7/25@Google can sympathise - the shift to mobile search has been accompanied by a fall in cost-per-click to advertisers.
2012/7/25@The newspaper industry has reiterated key points to Lord Justice Leveson: the financial wolves are at its door, with circulation dwindling and Google consuming advertising share; bloggers should not be allowed free rein if newspapers are spavined; and it will fight anything like state intervention into freedom of expression.
2012/7/25@Google agrees outline deal with EU to avoid long antitrust battle
2012/7/25@Google has agreed the outlines of a settlement with Europe's top competition authority, in a deal that would spare the US search giant from formal antitrust charges for allegedly abusing its dominance.
2012/7/25@In a big test for how Google handles the mounting regulatory scrutiny it is facing worldwide, the company offered to make significant changes to its business to avoid a lengthy EU legal battle and the threat of multibillion-dollar fines.
2012/7/25@While the deal must still be finalised, the talks have cleared an important hurdle that could save Google from the sort of decade-long fight in Brussels that dogged the likes of Microsoft and Intel.
2012/7/25@The breakthrough came after Google said it would in principle extend the remedies it had offered to make for PC-based search to cover mobile search services too.
2012/7/25@A two-year Brussels investigation had identified concerns with the way Google favours its own products in search results and demotes potential competitors, "copies" content from rivals without permission, shuts out competition with its advertising agreements with other websites and restricts advertisers from moving online ad campaigns to rival search engines.
2012/7/25@The Google proposal covers all of these areas.
2012/7/25@The 20-strong group of companies that complained about Google - including Microsoft, eBay and TripAdvisor - have pushed Brussels to take tough action against the internet group and will probably make their concerns clear if the remedies are seen as cosmetic.
2012/7/25@Google said it continued to "work co-operatively with the commission".
2012/7/25@Google is still under investigation in the US, Korea and India.

2012/7/28@Google opts for truce to avoid EU antitrust battle;
2012/7/28@Google was confronted with a strategic choice in Brussels this week and it opted for the path of settlement .
2012/7/28@In the event Google sought a truce.
2012/7/28@Mr Almunia decided that the Google offer provided a sound basis for advanced technical talks.
2012/7/28@Google has yet to disclose what it will do.
2012/7/28@But the concessions address four issues raised by Mr Almunia, who worries that Google favours its own products in search results and demotes rivals', copies content without permission and stifles competition.
2012/7/3@AQuantive was a leader in automating the selling and serving of display adverts over the internet, a business known as "adtech" and one where Google has been leader since its 2007 acquisition of DoubleClick.
2012/7/3@AQuantive was once a strong number two in the business but lost ground as Google benefited from the economies of scale and network effects that come from being the market's biggest, said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group.
2012/7/30@Apple and Microsoft, which were part of the consortium that won the Nortel auction, have a strong interest in keeping the patents out of the hands of rivals such as Google and Samsung, he added.
2012/7/30@The TMT sector is one of the fastest growing group of occupiers, with Amazon, Skype, Groupon and Google signing new leases in the past few months.
2012/7/31@Skiing trips are popular, too, from small companies (such as recruitment consultancy Freshminds) to the very large: Google once booked out an entire ski resort.
2012/7/31@Ross Levinsohn has resigned as Yahoo's head of global media, just two weeks after former Google executive Marissa Mayer was appointed the struggling web portal's new chief executive.
2012/7/31@At this year's shareholder meeting, Marissa Mayer , then a Google executive, was elected to Walmart's board.
2012/7/4@Meanwhile, Google has launched its own hotel and flight search tools and services and Microsoft's Bing Travel wants a slice of the pie as well.
2012/7/5@But technology companies such as Google and Facebook are wary of online copyright rules, which they fear could make them liable for links and content they cannot easily control.
2012/7/5@Google has to prove it can go beyond the search box
2012/7/5@There are two common complaints about the sort of radical personalisation that Google is attempting with its Google Now mobile search service.
2012/7/5@Google Now is an oxymoronic idea that might best be called "push search".
2012/7/5@Google says it has no plans yet to put advertising into the service, though this seems inevitable.
2012/7/5@My quick test of Google Now - which will officially be released in some handsets running Google's Android software in mid-July - suggests that the technology has a long way to go.
2012/7/5@Certainly Google starts from a strong position, with a wealth of data about users drawn from its different services.
2012/7/5@Mobile devices add the all-important dimension of place - and with 1m Android devices being activated a day, Google is starting to dominate in terms of sheer numbers.
2012/7/5@Like Apple's Siri voice-activated question-and-answer software, Google Now relies on being able to tap into large bodies of structured data - reams of organised information that can be polled for answers, rather than trying to trawl the web for documents that might contain the desired information.
2012/7/5@In its place, Google has been left to infer intent, using all the technological tricks at its disposal.
2012/7/5@Google is now as well-placed as any to try again - and with the rise of mobile, it has an urgent need.
2012/7/5@It is now up to Google to prove that it really can move beyond the search box.
2012/7/5@Google fell 9.5 per cent in the second quarter and, earlier this week, was 1.3 per cent higher at $587.83.
2012/7/6@Google Nexus 7
2012/7/6@In fact, the Google device, the size of the thinnest of paperback books, seems more of a rival to ereader tablets such as the Kindle or Barnes & Noble's Nook, than to the larger iPad.
2012/7/6@It comes with a $25 (£15) credit to use in the Google Play store, and pre-installed content such as the latest Transformers  movie, Bourne- series novel and Coldplay album.
2012/7/6@The Fire aims to lock its owners into using Amazon services, and all the indications are that the Nexus 7 will also require users to operate within a more closed Google ecosystem, with the emphasis on its Play store, cloud services and compatibility with other Android devices.
2012/7/6@This is a new feature of the Android 4.1 operating system, which Google developers have codenamed Jellybean.
2012/7/6@Google has unveiled a host of new software features alongside the Nexus 7.
2012/7/6@Google Now is a new version of Google's search app that is aware of your location and interests and can serve up relevant data such as local weather, sports scores and the time of your next bus - although I found the information limited and often irrelevant.
2012/7/6@Amazon could make things hotter for Google with a Fire update and Apple itself is rumoured to be planning a 7in iPad for later this year.
2012/7/6@For now, however, Google has set the bar on price and features for these pocket entertainment tablets.
2012/7/6@Google also rose, adding 1.4 per cent to $595.92.
2012/7/7@"Now, if you want to put in geothermal heat pumps, you Google them and can find local providers.
2012/7/7@This week, security researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Russian carrier MegaFon identified an app for both Apple's iOS and Google Android, Find and Call, that was sending out spam to the entire phonebook of anybody who downloaded it.
2012/7/7@But instead of taking on the iPad directly, Samsung, Amazon and Google have found a gap in the market by offering something different: a lighter, cheaper, pocketable device that is designed largely for consuming content, such as books, magazines and videos.
2012/7/7@Google and Amazon have also made competition tougher by selling their devices at, or below, manufacturing costs, with the intention of making money from the tablets' tethered content or web services.
2012/7/7@Using GPS data, collected rather like metadata on his photographs, he reconstructed his journey from satellite photos taken at the same time and captured on Google Earth.
2012/7/9@This has lifted Amazon's economic influence beyond its tech peers Apple, Google and Facebook and taken it into the realm of network businesses such as stock exchanges, power grid operators, credit card processors and shipping lines.
2012/7/9@Between 40 and 50 per cent of GoVacuum's revenue comes from Amazon's market place, an online bazaar where it pays a 15 per cent commission on each sale to access US consumers - 85m unique users in May alone, according to ComScore research - who use Amazon as the Google of product search and visit its site at a rate of 32 a second.
2012/7/9@But its move into infrastructure has received little scrutiny, partly because unlike the cool products of Apple, Google and Facebook, Amazon focuses on dull-but-difficult tasks such as managing product listings and delivering boxes.
2012/7/9@This is in spite of objections from alternative platforms such as Google Wallet and the fourth operator in the UK, Hutchison Whampoa's Three.
2012/6/1@Google to start charging retailers for listings in product searches
2012/6/1@Google is to start charging companies for listing their products in a core part of its search service, the first time it has converted a free section of its giant online index into a purely commercial venture.
2012/6/1@The change to Google Product Search will mean that many retailers who have relied on using the search engine to lure potential customers online will face higher costs, according to analysts.
2012/6/1@The move also raises the prospect that Google will eventually replace other parts of its free listings with adverts, said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land.
2012/6/1@Google said it was making the switch to enable it to show users higher quality results when they were looking for products online.
2012/6/1@The change in direction brings an end to a 10-year-old experiment in which Google tried to filter information about products from the web and make it available through a separate panel on its results pages.
2012/6/1@Yesterday, however, Google said that after a transitional period, only retailer who pay will have their products appear in the service, now called Google Shopping.
2012/6/1@Sameer Samat, Google Shopping's product manager, wrote in a blog post: "We believe that having a commercial relationship with merchants will encourage them to keep their product information fresh and up to date.
2012/6/1@Google proposes storing all your files in data centres, rather than on a computer's hard disk.
2012/6/1@The new Chromebook has a more powerful processor and Google says it operates at more than double the speed of the old laptop.
2012/6/1@On the software side, Google has restored the desktop.
2012/6/1@With the app icons, I expected a redesigned program or app to appear when clicked, such as the improved YouTube interface on Google TV.
2012/6/1@The Chromebook's speed is its greatest virtue, but with Ultrabook laptops appearing with similar instant on features and the imminent Windows 8 promising faster boot times and performance, Google is in danger of becoming the pacemaker that eventually has to drop out of the race.
2012/6/1@Google relies on users to report offending apps, which are then withdrawn from the Google Play store.
2012/6/1@Mr Cluley says, "Apple and Google need to look carefully at how well they protect users through their official application marketplaces, but there is more that they could do.
2012/6/1@The Danish data protection agency objected to the town of Odense using Google Apps' online office suite for similar reasons.
2012/6/11@According to reports by the Finnish media, the South Korean mobile phones maker is offering a premium price of EUR4.00 a share for Nokia, valuing the Finnish rival at an amount above the USD12.5bn value of Motorola Mobility's (NYSE:MMI) acquisition by Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG).
2012/6/12@Apple and Facebook chart strategy to counter Google
2012/6/12@The ability to post photos, map locations and links to Facebook directly from Apple devices marks a thawing in what has been seen as a potentially adversarial relationship and will bolster the two companies' efforts to compete with Google .
2012/6/12@Underlining that rivalry, Apple also introduced a home-grown Maps application, ousting the Google Maps app that has come preloaded on the iPhone since its launch in 2007.
2012/6/12@"With Maps, Apple is making a head-on assault on a core Google product, aiming to beat Google on its own turf.
2012/6/12@Google in French copyright deal;
2012/6/12@Google hailed what it called a "pioneering" agreement in France yesterday over digitising out-of-print books, ending six years of litigation between the US search company and French publishers.
2012/6/12@Antoine Gallimard, chief executive of the SNE, said: "Now it's up to every publisher to decide if they want or not, to sign a framework agreement with Google in line with copyright laws.
2012/6/12@Google said the agreement would "put France ahead of the rest of the world in bringing long-lost out-of-print works back to life", and could be a template for similar deals in other countries.
2012/6/12@Under the terms of the deal, a publisher or author can withdraw or authorise the scanning of titles by Google and if the publisher decides to sell the work as an electronic book, the proceeds will be shared such that the "majority of the revenue comes to the publisher", said Philippe Colombet, head of Google Books in France.
2012/6/12@Google also agreed to support financially a project to promote reading among children.
2012/6/12@French authors and publishers sued Google in 2006 for copyright violations, accusing it of "pirating other people's books", when the search engine scanned out-of-print books held in US libraries that were still in copyright.
2012/6/12@Google argued that the display of snippets was fair use under copyright law.
2012/6/12@Google still faces legal action in other countries, including the US, where a New York district court has rejected a 2008 deal it struck with the Association of American Publishers.
2012/6/12@Shares of Google dropped 2.1 per cent to $568.50.
2012/6/12@But while Facebook has reached 900m users without paying for adverts on any media platform, Google has in recent years begun to show ads for YouTube and Google+, its social network, including a TV spot last Christmas featuring the Muppets .
2012/6/13@Internet companies and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google would be under a new obligation to identify "trolls" who pose defamatory messages online, under Ken Clarke's libel reforms.
2012/6/13@Make sure your outfit is the first result that pops up on Google and a tidy profit is there for the taking.
2012/6/13@TomTom said: "There are three providers of digital maps - Nokia, Google and TomTom - and three main providers of mobile operating systems - Windows, Android and Apple's iOS.
2012/6/13@Shares of Google decreased 0.6 per cent to $565.10.
2012/6/13@Watchdog reopens Google Street View probe
2012/6/13@Google admitted in 2010 that cars working on its Street View map service had gathered private information from unsecured wireless networks.
2012/6/13@However, a report published in April by the US Federal Communications Commission found new -evidence that Google had failed to follow up on an email between an employee and his line manager -making them aware that the data were being collected and flagging it as a potential privacy concern.
2012/6/13@As a result, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office has written to Google informing the company that it has reopened its investigation.
2012/6/13@Among the answers the ICO is seeking is   precisely what kind of personal information was collected in the UK, at what point Google managers became aware of the data being gathered by its Street View cars, and why certain data were not included in the sample given to the regulator in its investigation in 2010.
2012/6/13@Google said: "We're happy to answer the ICO's questions.
2012/6/13@"However, during the course of our investigation we were specifically told by Google that it was a simple mistake.

2012/6/14@Key Google app unfriended amidFacebook and Apple love-in
2012/6/14@Could Apple and Google ever have hoped to stay friends?
2012/6/14@Those questions were thrown into sharp relief this week as Google Maps was dropped as the iPhone's default maps service, to be replaced by Apple's homegrown alternative.
2012/6/14@According to the narrative constructed by Steve Jobs, his company's close relationship with Google would have stayed rock-solid had the search company not turned on its ally and launched its Android software, challenging the iPhone.
2012/6/14@Yet it is hard to see that Google had much choice.
2012/6/14@That Google was right has been eloquently demonstrated this week by Apple's own actions this week.
2012/6/14@Apple will now need to prove that it can match a company like Google that was born in the services world.
2012/6/14@But will Facebook be willing to leave itself exposed any more than Google was?
2012/6/14@All of this suggests that Apple's new Facebook friendship should have a longer lease of life than the doomed Google relationship.
2012/6/15@That does not seem to be what Steve Jobs had in mind when he told his bio-grapher, Walter Isaacson, of his plan to wage "thermo-nuclear war" against Google over what he claimed was its slavish copying of Apple's iPhone.
2012/6/15@The Home Office has admitted it cannot force foreign companies such as Google and Facebook to relinquish sensitive data on UK citizens' phone calls, emails and internet usage, even as ministers unveiled legislation which they claim will strengthen the ability of police and intelligence services to access this material.
2012/6/15@When contacted, Facebook and Google declined to comment on the new bill.
2012/6/15@"There are still serious questions to be asked about whether Facebook and Google will be brought under RIPA [the regulation of investigatory powers act] and how far the government is willing to go in undermining internet security in order to fulfil its insatiable desire for data," Dr Hosein said.
2012/6/15@Amazon fell 0.2 per cent to $214.45, while Google closed 0.4 per cent lower to $559.05 after both companies showed their readiness to compete for domains.
2012/6/15@Last year, the EPO signed a partnership with Google to set up a machine translation service for patents.
2012/6/16@Apple has primed its army of developers for a battle with Microsoft and Google on laptops, tablets and smartphones.
2012/6/16@If a Google internet search took 25 minutes rather than 0.17 seconds, none of us would bother with it.
2012/6/16@While Amazon and Google applied for dozens of domains each , competing for potentially extremely valuable suffixes, such as .cloud and .search, the remainder of Silicon Valley seemed decidedly nonplussed by the process.
2012/6/16@Nike's attempt with Google to build a social network for football fans, joga.com, reached one million users in 2006 - a quarter the size of Facebook at the time - but the companies weren't ready for the work required to sustain the site.
2012/6/16@Hewlett-Packard lost 3 per cent to $21.64 and Google dropped 2.7 per cent to $564.51.
2012/6/19@Alternatively, could we see the likes of Google or Apple starting to look at the infrastructure-based operators?
2012/6/19@Google famously encourages its employees to develop side projects as part of their day-to-day role.
2012/6/19@Given that Google recently turned to press and out-of-home advertising to promote itself, is this another indicator of the fact that the so-called "new media" recognises the value of the "old media", and in fact the future promises to be of a close and healthy relationship between the two?
2012/6/2@For Google has just released a video demonstrating its new big idea - spectacles that act as a computer screen that responds to voice commands.
2012/6/2@And all the while, Google will be gathering more and more data on your life.
2012/6/2@RIM shares have fallen 28 per cent since the start of the year as the company struggles to compete with technology companies such as Apple and Google .

2012/6/22@Unlike the mass-market approach of Google or TripAdvisor, says Mr Harden, his approach is akin to "a like-minded club of people" who appreciate value for money, enjoy good food but are suspicious of celebrity chefs and can turn a nice phrase.
2012/6/22@Zagat, Harden's rival in the restaurant guidebook field, was bought by Google last year for a reported $150m.
2012/6/22@Google dispensed with Zagat's subscription website and opted instead to provide ratings for local restaurants for free in its search results.

2012/6/28@Google hardware
2012/6/28@Yesterday, Google announced a tablet computer that looks a lot like Amazon's Fire, just a week after Microsoft showed off the Surface , which apes Apple's iPad.
2012/6/28@Google also introduced a streaming media device for the living room with a passing resemblance to Apple TV .
2012/6/28@With the Nexus 7 tablet, Google is going cheap and small ($200, 7-inch screen) and is pushing the device as a front end for its Google Play media cloud storage and streaming service.
2012/6/28@This may give a bit of comfort to tablet makers who depend on Google's Android operating system, but Google putting so much of its own development and marketing muscle behind the Nexus 7 will scare them plenty.
2012/6/28@Surely Google does not aim to make profits in hardware (a lousy business), but rather to attract customers to its online services and keep them there.
2012/6/28@Do not forget, however, that Google has only proved that it can make big money from its search and display ad businesses.
2012/6/28@Google reveals prototype 'smart' glasses in effort to leapfrog rivals
2012/6/28@Google sought to leapfrog rivals such as Apple and Microsoft yesterday as it unveiled a prototype of a pair of "smart" glasses designed to carry out many of the functions currently done on a smartphone, such as sharing pictures and accessing information.
2012/6/28@Google said that an early version of its glasses would be shipped to a limited number of software developers, adding weight to its attempts to reposition itself as an innovator at a time when its size and bureaucracy is under attack from smaller, more nimble groups including Facebook.
2012/6/28@Google Glass, which has been in development for two and a half years, boasts a tiny display, worn like regular spectacles but sitting just above the right eye, to show data gathered from the internet.
2012/6/28@Mr Brin showed off the device in a demonstration to thousands of developers at a Google event in San Francisco.
2012/6/28@Despite predicting that the project would soon result in a consumer product, Google engineers admitted that they still had hurdles to overcome.
2012/6/28@Google  added 0.8 per cent to $569.30 as the company unveiled the launch of a new seven-inch tablet and a living-room media device running its latest Android software, hoping to compete with Apple and  Amazon , which closed unchanged at $225.62.

2012/6/30@Advances in AI leave Google feeling like the cat's whiskers
2012/6/30@The immense processing power of Google's global computing network and the brainpower of its secretive Google X research labs remain largely hidden from a curious world.
2012/6/30@Google scientists built the world's biggest electronic simulation of a brain, running on 16,000 computer processors, and discovered what it would learn when exposed to 10m clips randomly selected from YouTube videos.
2012/6/30@But in fact Google has made a significant advance in artificial intelligence, a research field that has promised much but delivered little to computer users.
2012/6/30@In their presentation at a machine learning conference in Edinburgh, the Google researchers demonstrated the company's ambitions in AI as well as the strength of its computing resources.
2012/6/30@Labelling, however, requires a lot of human labour and, as the Google researchers say, "there is comparatively little labelled data out there".
2012/6/30@Google needs to master what it calls "self-taught learning" or "deep learning", if it is to extend its search capabilities to recognise images among the vast volume of unstructured and unlabelled data.
2012/6/30@That would enable someone who, for example, owned an unidentified portrait painted by an unknown artist to submit a photograph of it to a future Google - and stand a reasonable chance of having both the scene and the painter identified through comparison with billions of images across the internet.
2012/6/30@The researchers used Google data centres to set up an artificial neural network with 1bn connections and then exposed this "newborn brain" to YouTube clips for a week, without labelling data of any sort.
2012/6/30@But Google will be more interested in the practical applications for its corporate ambitions in AI.
2012/6/30@Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean, the leaders of the neural study, say the project is not just about images: "We're actively working with other groups within Google to applying this artificial neural network approach to other areas such as speech recognition and natural language modelling.
2012/6/30@Over the past few years the company's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, have indicated their fascination with AI and their ultimate aim to give Google Search AI exceeding that of any human brain.
2012/6/30@Then you could ask any question in any language, and Google would search all the words, sights and sounds of the internet to come up with as much relevant information as you requested.
2012/6/30@Admittedly, Google can do much better with its more specialised machine translation services.
2012/6/30@Yet Google has grand ambitions for accelerating the arrival of AI.
2012/6/30@Google had $49bn in cash the last time I looked, and generated $3bn in free cash flow last quarter.
2012/6/30@Admittedly, in each and every case, there is also a coherent argument about a threat to growth: the end of mobile phone handset subsidies for Apple , slowing growth in online ad revenues at Google , and a failure to succeed in mobile handset and tablet computing (so far) at Microsoft .
2012/6/30@However, I can absolutely see how Apple or even Google might manage to generate bumper sales through some investment in new propositions.
2012/6/30@In fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that, if you are a defensive equity investor, a small basket of top tech behemoths, including Apple, Google and Microsoft might sit comfortably in your portfolio alongside tobacco giants, the bruised supermarket titans (I reckon Tesco is cheap) and a high-yielding pharma major or two.

2012/6/30@Google has placed its bet at the other end of the tablet spectrum - on a machine that will be primarily suited to consuming content.
2012/6/30@A second new Google gadget, a spherical computer called Nexus Q, for streaming music and video around the home, has been positioned very differently.
2012/6/30@As important as the hardware, meanwhile, were new deals with movie studios and others that will bring extra content to the universe of Google gadgets, creating a rival ecosystem of hardware and services to match those run by Apple and Amazon.

2012/6/7@In Europe, some analysts estimate up to 95 per cent of users start their internet journey on a Google search page.
2012/6/7@By proposing free services, Google has lured thousands upon thousands of SMEs and made them dependent on their services.
2012/6/7@The time has now come for Google to cash in.
2012/6/7@And so the Google trap closes on SMEs that will now need to pay to stay relevant.
2012/6/7@An ironic outcome, given it is the very content developed by these SMEs that makes Google relevant to users.
2012/6/8@But Google employee #107, who joined the search engine company as an engineer in its start-up days, has become a corporate version of the Shakespearean fool, a jester and a truth-teller.
2012/6/8@Called Search Inside Yourself, SIY is a training course much loved by Google workers, and now turned into a book with glowing endorsements from almost everyone you have ever heard of, from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt to former US president Jimmy Carter to the Dalai Lama.
2012/6/8@Whether or not this is true of Mr Page, Google co-founder, it does seem to be true of Meng.
2012/6/8@Most Google people are committed to their day jobs, and doing the other good stuff - staff engage in all sorts of things including building a hospital in India - makes them more so.
2012/6/8@Sergey Brin, the other Google founder?
2012/6/8@For this part-time job he would rather not be paid at all, indeed he doesn't need any money, having made a killing when Google floated.

2012/3/12@In his third speech at the industry trade show this month , Mr Schmidt focused instead on how Google and the mobile industry should work together to deliver value-added services to consumers - which he said would benefit everyone.
2012/3/12@As Apple, Google and Facebook fight it out for consumers' hearts, minds and wallets, by offering more storage space and easier ways to upload and download photos and movies, investors in the specialist property trusts that house data centres are lapping it up.
2012/3/13@Google
2012/3/13@This is despite expectations that Google will produce earnings per share growth of 17 per cent over the next three years, compared with 7 per cent at Microsoft and 11 per cent at IBM.
2012/3/13@It is hard for big technology companies that already dominate their markets to get valuations commensurate with their growth rates: Apple, after all, is just as cheap as Google and is expanding faster.
2012/3/13@This makes "buy Google on valuation" a hard short-term trade.
2012/3/13@But one quarter should not distract from the fact that Google has commanding market share (more than two-thirds, and growing, according to ComScore) in its core business, search advertising, which is itself growing fast.
2012/3/13@Perhaps, but Google is the rare company for which a $12bn acquisition counts as a reversible mistake.
2012/3/13@Its chips were in the first Google TV products, which have not made a big impact.

2012/3/2@Google rolls out privacy policy in defiance of EU legality warnings
2012/3/2@Google angered European regulators yesterday by rolling out a new privacy policy despite repeated requests to delay the project and warnings that it might not be lawful.
2012/3/2@The European Commission is expected to rule this month on whether Google has breached antitrust laws in how it operates its search service.
2012/3/2@The new privacy rules make it possible for Google to take what it has learnt about a user from one of its services - such as search or Gmail - and use it to tailor what that user sees on other services.
2012/3/2@Ms Reding said: "I support the French data protection authority's request to Google to delay the introduction of its new privacy policy until questions about the policy's compliance with EU data protection rules have been resolved.
2012/3/2@Google said it complies with local laws.
2012/3/2@Google has run an extensive campaign ahead of the changes.

2012/3/20@Last month, CNIL asked Google to postpone implementation because of "legitimate concerns about the protection of the personal data of European citizens".
2012/3/20@By merging the privacy policies of its different services, Google was making it impossible to work out which access rights, personal data and purposes applied to a particular service, it said.
2012/3/20@The queries also highlighted the difficulties users might face when trying to understand how Google used their data, CNIL said.

2012/3/21@Google has linked up with the MasterCard payment system and US telecoms operator Sprint to bring out its Wallet service for making one-tap payments with a mobile phone.
2012/3/21@"It's aimed at making it easier for you to pay for and save on the goods you want, while giving merchants more ways to offer coupons and loyalty programs to customers," Google wrote in a blog posting announcing the Wallet concept last May.
2012/3/21@But Google and others are already facing controversy over how they handle consumers' private information , and these concerns are likely to be amplified when it comes to their use of data about people's finances.
2012/3/21@Most existing payment schemes, such as Google Wallet, are linked to a regular bank account holding national currency.
2012/3/21@Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, recently revealed that the internet company had considered issuing its own currency, Google Bucks, but had moved away from the idea because of the complex regulations that surround such schemes.
2012/3/21@At the consumer level, cloud services such as Dropbox, a file sharing service, and applications such as Google Mail and Microsoft's Office Live, make a lot of sense: you do not have to manage the infrastructure yourself.
2012/3/21@In 2006 Google came knocking, Mr Duc says, offering the founders $5m for the company, as well as share op-tions and jobs with salaries of $8,000 a month.

2012/3/29@4 Never underestimate the value of a Google search
2012/3/29@While indicating yesterday that this week's deadline for his staff to complete their work on Google has slipped slightly, European competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia made it clear that a decision will follow soon.
2012/3/29@After more than two years of investigation and plenty of rhetoric that suggests he will not let this pass easily, it is unimaginable that Google will be given a completely clean bill of health.
2012/3/29@One is that Google gives unfair preference to its own services in its search results.
2012/3/29@Type a location, or the codes of two airports, into the search box and the top result will be a map from Google or suggested flight times with prices.
2012/3/29@The other complaint is that Google manipulates algorithms to harm rivals, whether by relegating them in its search rankings or by reducing the all-important quality score that is applied to the "landing pages" of advertisers.
2012/3/29@Google is right to argue that searchers want quick answers, not just a list of links to other sites - but those answers could be drawn from other services, not just Google's own.
2012/3/29@There are many ways the search interface could be adapted to prompt users to choose their own specialist services - indeed, Google itself once gave a choice of maps to select from.
2012/3/29@The other extreme, of forcing some degree of structural separation at the company to reduce the incentives for Google to manipulate the "black box" of search in its own favour, would be draconian and guarantee a transatlantic clash.
2012/3/29@That leaves relatively minor procedural steps and undertakings by Google as the most workable outcome - with tough penalties for any transgressions in future.
2012/3/29@Google already does much to help companies design their sites to work better with its search service and in some cases responds directly to complaints.
2012/3/29@The question will be whether Mr Almunia feels a package of remedies such as this is enough to limit Google's growing power - and whether Google itself feels it needs to make any concessions at all to head off what its leaders believe are wholly unwarranted concerns.
2012/3/29@Of course, even if Google concedes to a series of relatively unobtrusive remedies - with or without a statement of objectives - this is unlikely to be the end of the matter.
2012/3/29@Other issues are already stacking up in the Google case file.
2012/3/29@These include the rising influence of the Android mobile operating system, which has drawn complaints from mobile operators who balk at being forced to accept Google services as part of the deal.
2012/3/29@Google   , the second-most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, climbed 1.4 per cent to $655.76 as analysts at Citigroup raised their price target for the online search provider to $750.
2012/3/29@That move - and the global crisis - saw Mr Rabe's predecessors struggle with debts, forcing Bertelsmann to make savings and prune its portfolio as Apple, Google and Facebook changed the pecking order in the media sector.
2012/3/3@If the company can achieve operating margins of, say, 20 per cent within the next three to four years - admittedly short of Google or Facebook, but a long haul from Yelp's current losses - investors have to input fairly racy growth assumptions into a discounted cash flow model to return a $24 share price.
2012/3/3@Of course, the whole cost equation changes very fast if Yelp gets bought by a company that already has a huge technological and marketing backbone: Google or Yahoo, say.
2012/3/3@Those images appear because Google has taken a profile photo users uploaded to Google+, its social network, and incorporated it into their contacts' Gmail address book.
2012/3/3@One line in Google's privacy policy , which came into force on Thursday, explains how it is able to do this: "If other users already have your email or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.
2012/3/3@But when, in January, Google published this new document detailing how it is combining the personal information it holds about its users from its dozens of different products, many privacy advocates, data protection officials and state regulators let their simmering distrust of the internet company boil over.
2012/3/3@The new 2,300-word policy will take most people less than 10 minutes to read, but its most controversial point was summarised in Google's original blogpost on the matter: "We'll treat you as a single user across all our products, which will mean a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.
2012/3/3@California-based Google has, in past weeks, tried to warn as many users as possible about the changes, placing yellow banners across its sites.
2012/3/3@This week's new privacy policy opens the door for Google to combine all its information about users to allow the ads to follow the user, rather than the site, which digital marketers say will improve targeting and reduce wastage - and boost Google's prices.
2012/3/3@But as Google itself has admitted, some misconceptions have emerged.
2012/3/3@Google is not merging every single one of its pools of data.
2012/3/3@Only information from services for which people need to log in to Google will be cross-fertilised.
2012/3/3@Data that Google gathers as people browse sites it does not own - even if they are logged in - will not be melded with search history, YouTube or Gmail records.
2012/3/3@Although it has not ruled out changing its privacy policy again, Google provides some assurances: "We will not reduce your rights under this privacy policy without your explicit consent.
2012/3/3@On Thursday, Ms Reding told BBC radio that Google "utilises the data of private persons in order to hand it over to third parties" - a point Google has strenuously denied.
2012/3/3@Its advertising system works by marketers telling it what they are looking for, and Google matching that behind the scenes without showing its data to advertisers directly.
2012/3/3@"This is about the fact that Facebook owns a massive space on the internet and Google doesn't," said Gus Hosein of Privacy International.
2012/3/3@In the end, Google is betting that its users enjoy the improvements to its huge range of free services - from a search engine indexing billions of web pages and free smartphone software to seeing their friends' pictures appear on their BlackBerry - enough to tolerate the ever-growing exploitation of their personal information.
2012/3/3@When you sign up for a Google Account, Google asks for personal information, including your telephone and credit card numbers.
2012/3/3@Users of Google+, its social network, will also indicate to Google their relationships by adding friends to its "circles".
2012/3/3@When you visit a Google website, it gathers information about the computer or mobile device you are using, including your hardware model (for example, Dell PC, Apple iPhone); the software it is running; and which mobile or broadband provider supplies the internet connection.
2012/3/3@Google may associate this information with what you have supplied in your Google Account.
2012/3/3@Other information Google stores includes: search queries; on smartphones, your phone number and that of those you call, the time and duration of the conversation; and, if using a device with GPS or WiFi, where you are in the world.
2012/3/3@If you are concerned about the use of your data, use the Google dashboard and its ad preferences manager to manage your information
2012/3/3@O2, Google and T-Mobile all plan to launch similar devices in the UK, and high street chains, including Boots and McDonald's, have so far installed 80,000 contactless payment readers in outlets around the country.
2012/3/3@While Google is several years, and billions of dollars, ahead of Facebook with its search-based advertising, Facebook has an altogether different set of data about its users that it is showcasing to woo more advertisers to the social network.
2012/3/3@Just as Google moves into Facebook's territory by expanding its privacy policies to gain greater insight into its users' behaviour, Facebook is expected to tread into Google's domain: search.
2012/3/3@"Instead of ranking pages by how often they're linked to [as Google does], they'd be ranked by how often they're 'liked'.
2012/3/3@Facebook and Google are ramping up their own products targeted at local businesses and customer reviews.
2012/3/3@Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's chief executive, last year testified to congress that Google gives "preferential treatment" to its competing products .
2012/3/30@In 2007, Apple launched the iPhone and 18 months later came the first Google Android-based smartphone.
2012/3/30@Unlike RIM, which operated what Prof Adner calls "a BlackBerry biosphere", both Apple and Google encouraged users to customise their smartphones by downloading free or low-cost mobile apps and it took RIM years to catch up.
2012/3/31@And Google technology to create an ethno-map.
2012/3/5@Concerns linger that Pace's customers in the pay-TV market will be squeezed as consumers migrate to downloading TV programmes and videos over the internet from companies such as Google and Netflix.
2012/3/5@Large portions of that will go directly to Google and Facebook.
2012/3/6@Since the dotcom boom, the UK has built several successful tech companies, such as Betfair, Arm Holdings and Autonomy, but nothing   compared with Google   and Facebook - or the next wave of Silicon Valley groups such as Twitter, Airbnb and Dropbox.
2012/3/6@The lack of a local Google or Facebook can also create hiring problems.
2012/3/6@Nonetheless, the expansion of Google and Facebook's UK offices is helping to bridge the gap.
2012/3/6@"Being at Google gives you that opportunity to get a perspective on how big something can be," says Graham Cooke, one of four ex-Googlers who cofounded QuBit, a website optimisation company.
2012/3/7@Led by Facebook and Twitter, and joined by behemoths such as Google and a bevy of start-ups, these Silicon Valley misfits have muscled into the ad business and upended traditional assumptions about how companies should allocate marketing budgets.
2012/3/7@"But Google and Facebook are truly global media companies in a way the world has never seen.
2012/3/7@First Google and Yahoo, then Facebook and Twitter, now Tumblr, Instagram and Pinterest.
2012/3/7@"Big media companies such as Facebook, Google and Yahoo are able to work with advertisers across markets and regions to deliver campaigns at scale.
2012/3/7@Investors might hope Mr Sibal would focus on fixing the regulatory mess he presides over, including the cancellation of mobile phone licences and growing censorship threats to the likes of Google and Facebook.
2012/3/7@Google , the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, slipped 1.5 per cent to $604.96, despite Nomura analysts initiating coverage with a "buy" recommendation.
2012/3/7@Google adds music and books to Android Market
2012/3/7@Google is rebranding its Android Market as Google Play and adding music and book services in an attempt to compete better with Apple's iTunes in the smartphone and tablet market.
2012/3/7@Google Play adds the Google Music service launched last year and the Google eBookstore to the Android Market, which was already offering digital movie rentals.
2012/3/7@In a blog post yesterday, Google described the revamped service as "a digital entertainment destination where you can find, enjoy and share your favourite music, movies, books and apps on the web and on your Android phone or tablet".
2012/3/7@Google previewed the new service to its partners at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week and says the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.
2012/3/7@"It gives a very strong identity to the Google content ecosystem, and I think that's part of what our partners are so excited about," said Jamie Rosenberg, Google director of digital content.
2012/3/7@Google said existing apps would be renamed Google Play Movies, Google Play Books and Google Play Music on Android devices in the next few days.
2012/3/7@Google says there are more than 450,000 Android apps and games - triple the number given at the Mobile World Congress a year ago and closing in on the 550,000 claimed by Apple .
2012/3/7@However, after the aggressive entries into the market of Google and Apple in 2010 and with smartphones taking almost half the market in the US and Europe, last year finally saw a turning point.
2012/3/7@Google announced its mobile revenues hit $2.5bn during 2011, including searches on tablets such as the iPad, and Facebook announced it has 425m mobile users.
2012/3/7@However, despite Google and Apple lowering the upfront costs of their display advertising in February to encourage more into the market, price has not been the main barrier to brands' use of mobile.
2012/3/7@The positive sentiment lifted shares 11 per cent yesterday, as Mr Pulli shrugged off the threat of competition   from online content providers such as Google and Netflix.
2012/3/8@"Indonesia is not really search-savvy, not really accustomed to using Google to search for things," he says.
2012/3/8@It helped to build research universities such as Harvard and Stanford that remain the envy of the world - and aided the creation of Google and Facebook.
2012/3/8@Google thinks buying or streaming media will sell ads.
2012/3/8@This week it rebranded the Android store, to be known as Google Play, with greater emphasis on music, movies and books.
2012/3/8@Ms Whitman is now entirely dependent on Microsoft's ability to make the forthcoming Windows 8 the killer platform that is finally capable of competing with Apple and Google on mobile devices.
2012/3/8@Earlier this week, Google attempted to bolster its media portfolio by combining apps, music and movies into a mobile store, Google Play, aping Apple's content bundling in iTunes.
2012/3/8@"Venture capitalists get very excited in the early stages when they think you might be the next Google or Facebook.
2012/3/9@However, one of London Capital Group's clients opened an account and placed the first bet on Google at £1 point just after the stock had floated.
2012/3/9@Recent entrants to publishing, such as Amazon, Google and Apple, were "giant companies" with diverse products "and agendas other than just selling books", he said.
2012/3/9@Santiago de la Mora, director of print partnerships for Google in Asia, said a wholesale pricing model would be "the preferred route" to ensure lower prices.
2012/5/1@Abdel-Moneim Aboul Fotouh, an Islamist moderate and former Muslim Brotherhood leader - expelled from the group last year - received the backing of the moderate Islamist Wasat party; the Islamic Group, a once-outlawed militant organisation that advocated armed struggle; and of Wael Ghonim, the Google executive instrumental in the revolution last year.
2012/5/10@Google followed the Java formats but wrote its own code.
2012/5/10@Were Oracle to win its case, Google would have to seek a licence for Java or face the unpalatable option of rewriting its APIs, making them incompatible with existing Android apps.
2012/5/10@With suits flying among some of the best-known tech names, companies such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft have been forced to spend heavily in the past year or so to arm themselves legally, in turn pushing up prices for patents such as Ms Mast-hoff's as they change hands.
2012/5/10@Having lost out in this case - and been left in a weak patent position compared to Apple and Microsoft, which were among the auction's winners - Google agreed six weeks later to pay $12.5bn for Motorola Mobility, mainly to get its hands on the telecoms group's intellectual property.
2012/5/10@On one side are cash-rich companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, with the wherewithal and incentive to pay large amounts for legal protection.
2012/5/10@Yahoo went as far as preparing a lawsuit against Google in 2006 over its core search technology, according to someone familiar with the initiative, but called it off after senior managers shrank from the business risks.
2012/5/11@Although the launch of rival services from the likes of Google has increased competition in these markets, interest remains high among digital investors, with WPP last month investing $7m in MySupermarket , which compares online grocers.
2012/5/12@Google searches on the eurozone and various phrases connected to its break-up show a strong correlation with the eurozone crisis.

2012/5/15@In the mobile world, however, it is just another app developer, reliant on platforms owned by Apple and Google for distribution.
2012/5/15@Google may also bristle if Facebook moves to oust its own Checkout payment platform from Android apps.
2012/5/15@Google move strikes Moneysupermarket
2012/5/15@Moneysupermarket suffers as Google moves on price comparison
2012/5/15@Visitors arriving through Google provide about a third of Moneysupermarket's revenue, according to Numis.
2012/5/15@Google has previously struggled to break into consumer finance.
2012/5/15@But the £38m acquisition last year of BeatThatQuote gives Google key staff and industry knowhow for price comparison, suggesting a more serious approach, Numis said.
2012/5/15@The chances of a bid from Google or private equity for Moneysupermarket also looked to have been reduced, it argued.
2012/5/15@The company responded by arguing that it was a trusted and independent brand that consumers would seek out, whereas Google would have to overcome "some lack of trust" with data.
2012/5/16@The Financial Times last week revealed that the Federal Trade Commission had launched an investigation into the takeover and had asked Google and Twitter for information.
2012/5/16@"What Google had was an unbelievable revenue engine, which said that if you put this amount of money in you'll get this much out.
2012/5/17@Google to unveil new search facility
2012/5/17@Google is preparing the biggest overhaul of its search results in five years, in a change that is likely to draw more fire from rivals as antitrust investigations into the company intensify.
2012/5/17@Coming two days before Facebook's closely watched   initial public offering, the move also marks an attempt by Google to focus on its key weapon in the online wars.
2012/5/17@The criticisms are set to escalate with the launch of Knowledge Graph, which Google plans to roll out in "the next few days", though it characterised the changes as a way to make the web more useful rather than an attempt to replace it with a private database.
2012/5/17@From the invitation-only Google Zeitgeist to the Do Lectures and the growing number of Tedx events, offshoots of the hugely influential Ted talks, ideas festivals represent a move away from traditional forms of business education and professional development.

2012/5/17@As Kevin Pleines, analyst at Birinyi Associates, a stock research firm, puts it: "If looking for an investment, the best course of action may be to avoid the first day of trading frenzy, and wait and see if the IPO is going to be a Google or a Groupon.
2012/5/18@A sign of a hot Android product is when Google gives thousands away to reward developers at its annual conference.
2012/5/18@Shares in Google had their best run of an otherwise poor year in the weeks following Apple's move.
2012/5/18@Google shares climbed 5 per cent over the rest of March, outperforming the iPhone manufacturer, as investors speculated that a dividend announcement might be imminent.
2012/5/18@But none was forthcoming and Google has since given back its March gains.
2012/5/18@Google itself still maintains a powerful position in search and has extended its reach into email, mobile and video.
2012/5/19@At the same stage in its own development - when its quarterly revenues first topped $1bn, in 2005 - Google was also valued at close to $100bn.
2012/5/19@However, Google was growing by nearly 100 per cent a year, compared with slowing growth that has brought Facebook down to 45 per cent.
2012/5/19@"A surprising number of the top executives at Google are still working at the company - people with $50m or $100m who don't need to work for a living," he said.
2012/5/19@His supporters include Google executive Wael Ghonim, who helped organise last year's uprising against Hosni Mubarak, ultraconservative Salafist Islamists seeking to establish sharia law, and smatterings of leftists, secular liberals and Christians.

2012/5/2@While Samsung has enjoyed success with the Note and built Google its own flagship smartphone in the Galaxy Nexus, it is the Galaxy S that has won the most praise from critics and customers.
2012/5/21@Chief business officer, Google
2012/5/21@That sounds like the last thing Google would once have needed - after all, services such as search and YouTube were built through "viral" word-of-mouth and the company is organised round a belief that the best idea will always win out.
2012/5/21@Yet these days Google has a lot of persuading to do, and Mr Arora is persuader-in-chief.
2012/5/21@These are useful traits given the job at hand: winning over media companies and advertisers that have often thought of Google as arrogant and aloof.
2012/5/21@" The problem, he suggests, was not that Google pushed the envelope recklessly (it still faces landmark lawsuits from Viacom and the book industry), but that it came to be blamed, unfairly, for all the evils of the web.
2012/5/21@Seven years ago there was more demand for Google people than we had people.
2012/5/21@The problem, he says, lay in the difficulty of hiring enough people to answer phone calls from advertisers, rather than in any cultural or philosophical rejection of accepted norms of customer service - even though Google executives once revelled in the "scalability" of their self-service system precisely because it did not require expensive humans.
2012/5/21@A former head of marketing at T-Mobile Europe, he joined Google in London in 2004 to develop and run business operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
2012/5/21@He came to the company after being interviewed by co-founder Mr Brin at the British Museum - part of the famously long Google screening process.
2012/5/21@What he calls "the first 'Aha', or insight" dates from that time: to accept business from as many new countries as possible, long before Google had operations on the ground.
2012/5/21@But hasn't Google itself been on the wrong end of one of the biggest trends online: the rise of social networking?
2012/5/21@Google is behind in the race to amass the social information it will need to drive this next wave of online advertising.

2012/5/22@EU warns Google to change or face fines
2012/5/22@Europe's top antitrust enforcer yesterday delivered an ultimatum to Google to put its house in order or risk hefty fines, in the most significant transatlantic competition spat since Brussels waged its legal war with Microsoft a decade ago.
2012/5/22@Should Google refuse to compromise and settle with the European Commission, it faces formal charges that could lead to fines of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue and a Microsoft-style fight through the courts stretching for years.
2012/5/22@Mr Almunia identified possible antitrust problems in how Google favours its own products in search results; "copies" content from rivals without permission; shuts out competition with its advertising agreements with other websites; and restricts advertisers from moving their online ad campaigns to rival search engines.
2012/5/22@"I hope Google seizes the opportunity to swiftly address our concerns," he said.
2012/5/22@Google has long called for talks with the commission over its concerns.
2012/5/22@Without Google proposing clear cut solutions that show good faith, Mr Almunia is ready to serve the company with a formal charge sheet.
2012/5/22@Google said it had "only just started to look through the commission's -arguments".
2012/5/22@"Competition on the web has increased dramatically in the last two years since the commission started looking at this and the competitive pressures Google faces are tremendous.
2012/5/22@The public challenge to Google over a settlement is a first in a big EU competition case and reflects the high stakes.
2012/5/22@About 17 complaints have been lodged against Google in Brussels by various rivals, including Microsoft, TripAdvisor and Expedia.

2012/5/23@Google prepares for Brussels brinkmanship
2012/5/23@But an unorthodox twist was added in the Google case by Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition chief and former Socialist candidate for Spanish prime minister.
2012/5/23@For the first time in a big EU investigation, Mr Almunia announced talks had begun while publicly confronting Google with a list of his concerns that it must fix or face charges.
2012/5/23@While it can impose multibillion-dollar fines and force Google to change its business model without ever going to court, officials realise the tech world often outpaces a formal legal process and appeals, which can stretch for years.
2012/5/23@Mr Almunia decided it was better to announce these usually private talks were under way because of the level of outside interest and the fact Google has long demanded a chance to "discuss" his concerns before any charges are laid.
2012/5/23@What startled some lawyers is that Mr Almunia did this by delivering an effective ultimatum, setting a very public benchmark for Google to clear before it has been accused of an infringement.
2012/5/23@Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who represents several Google rivals, said it "looks more like what a politician would do who wants to find a compromise, not a piece of antitrust enforcement.
2012/5/23@In the first meeting, competition officials will tell Google they must make a "serious and credible offer" to eliminate broad competition concerns.
2012/5/23@While saying it "disagrees" with Mr Almunia's conclusions, Google is keeping its counsel about a settlement.
2012/5/23@Kate Sutton, director of Streetmap.co.uk, said she was "totally unconvinced that Google will voluntarily deliver any remedies that go anyway towards repairing the harm it has done to my business".

2012/5/24@Google has hit back at an EU ultimatum for it to stop its allegedly anticompetitive business practices, with a firm denial of wrongdoing that will dent the European Commission's hopes of a quick settlement.
2012/5/24@Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's top competition official, on Monday gave Google "a matter of weeks" to make a serious offer to address his concerns and head off formal charges and a hefty fine.
2012/5/24@The commission will in coming days give Google a more detailed oral briefing on its competition concerns.
2012/5/24@While it will be given a broad indication of the legal arguments underpinning the EU concerns, Google will have to make a significant and credible offer to settle before it will be given a written summary of the case against it.
2012/5/24@But if Google is unwilling to make an early proposal to resolve commission concerns within the next few weeks, Mr Almunia has made it clear he will serve the US group with formal charges.

2012/5/3@Second: can Facebook fundamentally change advertising in a way Google did over the last decade?
2012/5/3@The goal is collecting piles of data about users to develop advertising that targets consumers precisely, thus giving advertisers high and measurable returns - as Google did with search advertising.
2012/5/3@Back when Google was growing at a similar pace to Facebook, its margins were much lower, and remain lower today.
2012/5/3@[Chart 1: showing comparable sales and margins at Facebook, Google and Microsoft]
2012/5/3@The dis-analogy with Google here is striking.
2012/5/3@Google can offer advertisers ads that hit very specific groups because a search engine is for, well, searching.
2012/5/3@For comparison, when Google had the same revenues as Facebook does now it took only seven years for revenues to increase another ten times.

2012/5/31@While Amazon is happy to live on very slim margins as it tries to extend the Kindle into the tablet market, it is hard to believe the same is true of Google as its executives insist through gritted teeth that they are happy to live with the profitability dilution from Motorola.

2012/10/10@Some opponents have called on Google to subject its in-house services to the same criteria as those applied to other sites on the web, ensuring that it cannot unfairly corner an audience.
2012/10/10@The Google proposal was made in response to a call from Joaquín Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, for concessions that would address concerns raised in a probe that began nearly three years ago.
2012/10/10@The talks remain in flux and it is unclear if the offer will satisfy Mr Almunia, or if Google has been prepared to make further concessions.
2012/10/10@Although he agreed the broad outlines of a pre-charge settlement with Google , Mr Almunia has said they are "not there yet" and made it clear talks could not drag on.
2012/10/10@Google's practice of injecting answers from its other services high up in its search results - for instance, putting a stock quote from Google Finance at the top of the page - is the thorniest of four issues Mr Almunia singled out in May .
2012/10/10@Google declined to comment on the labelling solution, but said: "We continue to work co-operatively with the European Commission.
2012/10/10@Google
2012/10/10@Google has signalled willingness to put clear labels on its own services, from maps to stock quotations to flight schedules, when these appear prominently in search results.
2012/10/10@That is an effort to placate European regulators, which worry that Google uses its dominant position in general or "horizontal" search to squeeze out competitors in "verticals", such as travel or shopping.
2012/10/10@And consumers' desire for full information means too much self-serving fiddling by Google may drive them away.
2012/10/10@That explains why Google is already reasonably transparent.
2012/10/10@It is not hard to look at a results page and to find the paid ads and the Google products, or to find its competitors.
2012/10/10@If Google wants to stay ahead of the regulators, it could also make it easier for consumers to configure their settings, allowing them to pick which mapping or travel programs, say, come up along with searches.
2012/10/10@Google has an excellent product - but the company must be sure not to trip up on its own ambitions.

2012/10/17@Apple hopes to maintain its dominance in the tablet market despite competition from Microsoft, Google and Amazon with a cheaper, smaller iPad , which is expected to be unveiled next week.
2012/10/17@One indication of regulators' increasing concern over online privacy came yesterday when EU privacy commissioners called for Google to substantially change a privacy policy, which allows it to deploy users' information across a wider range of services, or risk substantial fines.
2012/10/17@Although the banks process the payments that underpin these transactions, they face similar privacy issues to those that have caused problems for Google and other internet search engines, and it is unclear how they might benefit from the information they acquire.
2012/10/17@Google told to alter privacy policy;
2012/10/17@EU regulators have told Google to change its privacy policies substantially or risk fines, a move that threatens to slow the US search -company's introduction of products and advertising schemes in Europe.
2012/10/17@European privacy watchdogs said a probe led by the French regulator CNIL showed Google failed to provide users with adequate information about how their personal data were being used across the US group's platforms.
2012/10/17@Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, CNIL chairwoman, said unless Google implemented changes in three to four months, the dispute would "move on to another phase, a sanctions phase".
2012/10/17@Google introduced sweeping changes this year to the terms and conditions governing how it can use data about its hundreds of millions of customers - enhancing its ability to profile consumers and deliver targeted advertising.
2012/10/17@For instance, the privacy policy changes permit Google to use data from YouTube video-viewing to inform advertising in Gmail.
2012/10/17@Among the first products to launch after the changes is Google Now, which pushes out information about sports results or heavy traffic which it believes is relevant based on a user's past searches or location information.
2012/10/17@"Combining personal data on such a large scale creates high risks to the privacy of users," wrote the working group Article 29, which represents privacy officials in EU countries, in a three-page letter to Larry Page , Google chief executive.
2012/10/17@"We expect that Google takes the necessary steps to improve information and clarify the -combination of data and, more generally, ensure compliance with data protection laws and principles.
2012/10/17@Viviane Reding, EU commissioner for justice, backed the national watchdogs' decision to hold Google accountable.
2012/10/17@"Consumers have been kept in the dark about how much data Google collects and what happens to that data and Google's new privacy policy only further disguised what really happens when you use their services," said Nick Pickles, head of Big Brother Watch, a privacy campaign group.
2012/10/17@Google faces fines, Page 15 Digital piracy battle, Page 18
2012/10/17@But European regulators are right to increase the pressure by demanding that Google alter its controversial privacy policy , even if this could have consequences for all those offering internet services.
2012/10/17@Google erred when it ignored the request of European regulators to delay its new privacy policy in March.
2012/10/17@This pools user data it gathers across 60 online services, allowing Google to offer advertisers a better way to target customers.
2012/10/17@Google will have to show it has the "unambiguous consent" of users to combine data and better explain how, why and for how long it intends to hold on to this information.
2012/10/17@Google has a hefty development bill to pay and the personal information left behind by consumers is a valuable currency.
2012/10/17@On this score, companies such as Google and Facebook still have much to prove.
2012/10/17@Yet tech companies are much more scalable than traditional enterprises, and world-beaters such as Google have proved that you can grow by creating online traffic - and let revenue follow afterwards.
2012/10/18@But next week's expected unveiling of a smaller, seven-inch iPad is not only the least well-kept secret since the launch of its original touchscreen computer: it is also the clearest evidence yet that Apple is trying to consolidate its gains, and other companies, notably Google and Amazon, are the ones on the offensive now.
2012/10/18@The war between tech ecosystems, in which Google and Amazon have moved into hardware as Apple has pushed deeper into internet services, has ushered in a new competitive phase.
2012/10/18@This was an obvious piece of the puzzle that Apple needed to put in place as it repelled Google from its mobile platform.

2012/10/19@Disappointing third-quarter earnings from Google were accidentally published several hours earlier than planned, sparking a panicked sell-off of the internet company's shares until trading was halted for more than two hours.
2012/10/19@Stunned investors wound up sending Google shares 8 per cent lower as it missed earnings forecasts by more than a dollar, reflecting a continued fall in advertising prices and costs associated with its acquisition of Motorola Mobility.

2012/10/19@Google
2012/10/19@Excluding the revenue Google returns to its advertising partners, sales grew 17 per cent, less than half the rate of a year ago.
2012/10/19@Google results show the operational cost of acquiring the troubled group, says
2012/10/19@The bulk of the $12.5bn price Google paid for Motorola Mobility was largely related to its patent portfolio, but Google's third-quarter numbers showed the operational cost of an internet company acquiring a struggling phonemaker.
2012/10/19@Google is already working on those costs, having announced plans to cut Motorola's workforce by around 20 per cent, or 4,000 jobs, in August .
2012/10/19@Earlier this month, Google tried to head off concerns about Motorola's impact on its bottom line by accelerating that restructuring process outside the US.
2012/10/19@When this month Google abruptly terminated its first patent litigation against Apple since the Motorola deal closed in May, investors might have become confused as to the rationale behind the acquisition.
2012/10/19@Google shares closed 8 per cent lower.
2012/10/19@But Google said about half of that was because of foreign exchange costs, with Patrick Pichette, finance chief, stressing that many factors affected ad prices, including the proportion shown on partners' sites and growth in emerging markets, where ad rates are generally lower.
2012/10/19@"As we transition from one screen to multiscreen, Google has an enormous opportunity to innovate and drive ever-higher monetisation.
2012/10/19@To prove his point, Mr Page announced that Google had reached an annualised run-rate in mobile revenues of $8bn, up from $2.5bn a year ago.
2012/10/19@The latest figure includes revenues from mobile apps and other content downloaded from Google Play, the store bundled with its Android smartphones, which 2011's number did not, but advertising remains the "vast majority" of its mobile income, Mr Pichette said.
2012/10/19@This week's news that Twitter had blocked a neo-Nazi account in Germany marks a significant moment, highlighting how the site now faces the same dilemmas around balancing free speech and legal compliance that Google and Facebook have long had to tackle.
2012/10/19@Twitter also said that it would "clearly mark" when it had withheld a tweet, both with a notification on its site and by posting the legal request to ChillingEffects.org, a site used by Google and other internet companies.
2012/10/19@Twitter's first notification to ChillingEffects appeared this week, when it - along with Google and Facebook - bowed to a request from the German police to block the account of a neo-Nazi group deemed illegal.
2012/10/19@Technology stocks were hit, dragged down by a plunge in Google and a steep decline in Apple.
2012/10/19@Google  fell by 10 per cent immediately after earnings from the group were released by mistake at around midday, prompting a temporary halt in trading of its shares.

2012/10/24@Stuart Jeffrey, analyst at Nomura, said that the iPad mini's 65 per cent price premium over rivals such as Amazon's Kindle Fire would allow it to preserve its gross margins at more than 30 per cent but "allows for Amazon and Google to continue to build out their positions" in the tablet market, attracting more developers to Google's Android platform "and thus narrow the gap with the iPad over time".

2012/10/5@A trove of out-of-print books that have been mouldering in library stacks for decades is to go on sale in ebook form for the first time, following a legal settlement between Google and a group of book publishers.
2012/10/5@After seven years of tortuous legal wrangling and tussles with US regulators, Google will have the right to sell out-of-print books that it has scanned which are still in copyright, provided the publishers agree.
2012/10/5@The settlement is likely to cover "hundreds of thousands or millions" of the 20m books that Google has scanned so far, said Tom Turvey, who heads the company's digital book efforts.

2012/9/26@The order, against which Google is appealing, is the second time this month that an electoral court in Brazil has tried to arrest a top executive at the company for failing to delete YouTube videos attacking a mayoral candidate.

2012/9/27@Resurgent Google puts one over rivals
2012/9/27@By pushing the search company's shares to their first record high in almost five years, they delivered a vote of confidence in the new, more diversified advertising business that has become the basis for Google's latest surge of growth - while also giving an implicit thumbs-down to Facebook, whose short-term chances of putting Google in the shade, at least in business terms, have receded sharply .
2012/9/27@"More and more people are searching for things on their tablets: Google wins," said Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Barclays, who estimates that these search adverts yield as much as 75-90 per cent of those on PCs.
2012/9/27@Search advertising could now be set for a further boost in the coming months as Google launches a new product listing service, which lets advertisers display far more information about goods for sale.
2012/9/27@The problems some other internet companies have had in making money from mobile have led investors to shift their money into Google instead, said Mr DiClemente, though he did not single out Facebook by name.
2012/9/27@Google is now worth more than four times as much as Facebook - a gap that could grow further, according to some analysts, given that Google's shares are trading at only around 15 times its expected 2013 earnings, compared with a multiple of 32 times for Facebook.
2012/9/27@A lack of transparency, in particular, has made it hard to tell just how well Google has been managing the underlying transition in its advertising business.
2012/9/27@Rivals who said Google should never have been allowed to use the cash flow from search to fund marketleading positions in display and mobile advertising have not missed the chance to turn its success against it.
2012/9/27@"Google's sky-high profits come at the expense of every small business on the internet that pays a hidden tax in higher online advertising costs that ultimately get passed on to their customers as a result of the search giant's abuse of its monopoly power," said FairSearch, a lobby group made up of Google rivals such as Microsoft, Expedia and Oracle.
2012/9/27@A six-year acquisition spree aimed at making Google a force in the display advertising business is finally paying off.
2012/9/27@The deals that have put Google on the map began with the $1.65bn purchase of YouTube in 2006, which has taken years to show meaningful results.
2012/9/27@A second key acquisition came with the $3.1bn purchase of DoubleClick in 2008, bringing Google a network that serves adverts on sites across the web.
2012/9/27@The purchase of Admob, a mobile advertising company acquired two years ago, has also made Google the leader in this market, though it remains a small part of display overall.

2012/9/29@In yesterday's open letter on Apple's website, Mr Cook suggested that customers should continue to use Google Maps through a web app, as well as suggesting other alternatives by smartphone rivals, including Nokia and Microsoft, while Apple works to fix the problem.
2012/9/29@Reports on tech blogs in recent days have suggested that Apple's agreement with Google was due to expire within the next 12 months.
