has returned around 6 percent, outpacing the 4 percent total return of the s&p500 index of domestic shares. even after the crash, the s&p500 is up 41 percent since mr. obama was inaugurated. the s&p500 has now fallen 10.7 percent from 1,345 on july 22, underlining the new negative investment sentiment about the economy and about europe. the vix, which measures the implied volatility of options on the s&p500 index, and is called the fear index by traders, spiked on thursday, though it is still much lower than during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. in the end, the broader market as measured by the s&p500 index was unable to muster a gain, just barely slipping into the red with a 0.69 point decline. at the much-anticipated opening  bell, the dow, the s&p500 and the nasdaq indexes all rose and within minutes were each up more than 1 percent. ''there is no sign of momentum turning higher,'' said david sneddon, a technical analyst at credit suisse, adding that the s&p500 could head as low as 1,100. by noon, the s&p500 was down 32 points, or 2.6 percent. futures contracts for the s&p500 rallied more than 30 points within minutes, and it looked like this could be a relatively uneventful day. near midday, financial stocks were the worst-performing sector among the s&p500 amid a broad market sell-off.  futures contracts for the s&p500 rallied more than 30 points within minutes, and it looked like this could be a relatively uneventful day. the s&p500 index declined 6.7 percent on monday alone. the s&p500 is now down 18 percent from its april 29 peak and is nearing official bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 percent. all 500 stocks in the s&p500 index were lower by the end of the day. just before the statement came out at 2:15, the s&p500 was in 1,140 range, and by 2:45 it had dropped to about 1,100. and among the stocks in the s&p500 - all of which had finished lower on monday - there were 493 gainers on tuesday. the s&p500 index was up 24 points, or 2.19 percent. the s&p500 index is now up more than 2 percent. the s&p500 index  was  up 1 percent. by that standard, the s&p500 -- which closed with a p/e ratio of 19.3 on monday afternoon -- may now be very slightly undervalued.  by that measure, the s&p500 remains about 20 percent overvalued, despite the recent sell-off.  over the long-run, according to mr. shiller's data, the value of the s&p500 has appreciated by about 2.2 percent annually, adjusted for inflation. if the real value of the s&p500 increased by 8 percent a year  dividends and inflation, it would be valued at about 2,000,000 points right now. historically, the current valuation of the s&p500 (as of monday afternoon's close) has been associated with an annualized return of about 4.3 percent over the next 10 years, including dividends but after inflation. specifically, you've lost about 17 percent of your stake since february if you had been invested in an s&p500 index fund. for instance, s&p500 prices have tended to move in the same direction from month to month. since 1871, a month in which the s&p500 gains value relative to inflation has been followed by another winning month 63 percent of the time, whereas a loss has been followed by another loss 53 percent of the time. it also represents an increase of nearly 10% vs. our prior proposal of $86 per share despite the fact that the s&p500 has declined 14% since may 3, 2011, the last business day prior to our previous letter. this year, the s&p500 has fallen about 18 percent since may, as concerns over government debt in the u.s. and europe and weak economic growth around the world have mounted. there were only two previous times since the great depression when the s&p500 moved at least 4 percent in four consecutive trading sessions. (photograph by mario tama/getty images) (b5) charts: four consecutive days of volatility are rare: since the great depression, there have been only three occasions when the s&p500 rose or fell more than 4 percent in each of four consecutive sessions. that is nearly double the 6.3 percent decline of the s&p500 since january. stocks sold off the next week, with the s&p500 and the dow jones industrial average finishing the five-day period nearly 2 percent lower. on monday, however, the broader market as measured by the s&p500 inched above the pre-downgrade level to close at 1,204.49, after gaining 25.68 points, or 2.2 percent.  the s&p500 is more than 10 percent below where it was as recently as july 22. the s&p500 was down 1.40 percent in afternoon trading in the united states.the euro fell 0.48 cents to $1.4396. the s&p500 has now fallen more than 16 percent from its april 29 peak. futures on the s&p500 index were o.4 percent lower in asia. on thursday, the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the s&p500 finishing lower; most rattled were industrial and material companies. the chicago board options exchange's vix index of s&p500 volatility soared more than 35 percent to top 42 on thursday. at the close, the s&p500 was down 17.12 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,123.53. so far this year, there have been 241 dividend increases or initiations among s&p500 companies, versus only three dividend cuts, according to howard silverblatt, s.& p.'s senior index analyst. that's more than double the amount of dividend increases that s&p500 companies delivered in the first eight months of last year and is a reversal from the $41 billion in dividend cuts made from january to august 2009. s&p500 companies are sitting on $1.13 trillion in cash and short-term investments -- two-thirds more than they had heading into the recession in 2007, according to capital iq. in the last few weeks, we've lived through a historic seesaw, including a period when the s&p500 either rose or fell over 4 percent for each of four consecutive days. even after monday's rise, the s&p500 was down 17.4 percent from its recent peak on april 29, close to bear market territory, which is defined as a drop of 20 percent. it is also called the fear index, and as the s&p500 has spiraled down and up, vix futures and options have become a popular tool for all sorts of fearful investors to protect themselves against the swings -- and maybe even make a little money. since aug. 8, when the s&p500 hit its recent low of 1,119.46, the index has risen about 8 percent.  if you had invested in just the s&p500 over that 10-year period (2000-2010) your annualized return, including dividends, was 1.4 percent per year. too often when we hear the market report for the dow, the s&p500 and even the tech-heavy nasdaq, we let those numbers become our investing reference point. clearly things were bad for the s&p500 during the past decade, but singling out one market to declare a decade of investing as "lost" ignores the reality: a broadly diversified portfolio can deliver respectable returns even if individual classes perform poorly. both indexes ended the week lower, the dow by 0.3 percent and the s&p500 by 0.2 percent. if you had invested in just the s&p500 over that 10-year period (2000-2010) your annualized return, including dividends, was 1.4 percent per year. too often when we hear the market report for the dow, the s&p500 and even the tech-heavy nasdaq, we let those numbers become our investing reference point. clearly things were bad for the s&p500 during the past decade, but singling out one market to declare a decade of investing as ''lost'' ignores the reality: a broadly diversified portfolio can deliver respectable returns even if individual classes perform poorly. the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets index has plummeted more than 10 percent, versus a 6.7 percent decline for the s&p500 index of domestic stocks. during  those 34 years the s&p500 had an annualized return of 11.17 percent, and  international stocks had an annualized return of 10.72 percent. from 1976-2010, the s&p500  had 42 negative quarters and a standard deviation of 15.39 percent. so let's create portfolio c using use a fairly  standard 60 percent allocation to the s&p500 and 40 percent allocation to international  stocks. while that's not much  better than the s&p500 alone, in terms of risk, this 60/40  portfolio only had 37 negative quarters with a standard deviation of 14.45 percent. the s&p500 financial sector index lost 2.3 percent. clark yingst, the chief market analyst at joseph gunnar, said that the fall of the euro against the dollar on friday, resulting in a six-month low, suggested that the s&p500 had not yet completed its recent correction. after all, the s&p500 index is roughly where it was a year ago and, after the roller coaster of august, finished less than 6 percent down. all 10 main industries in the s&p500 advanced, and gains were led by industrial, raw material and technology companies. the s&p500 was up 10.6 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,172.87 after falling as much as 0.4 percent. the yield on the 10-year treasury note hit a record low on monday of 1.87 percent and the s&p500 has risen only three days this month. netflix fell almost 19 percent to $169.25, the biggest drop among stocks in the s&p500 index, after the company said it expected fewer people to subscribe to its dvd-by-mail service as well as its streaming movie service. still, the encouraging headlines out of europe helped the s&p500 post a 5.4 percent gain for the week, its best since early july, and the five-day string of gains was the broad index's strongest since the end of june. stocks began to recover in the spring of 2009 and had doubled in value by april of this year, as measured by the s&p500 index. among the highlights: 65 percent of the s&p500 companies responding to a survey said they had integrated climate change issues into their overall business strategies, up from 35 percent in 2010. in fact, if this slide stops short of the 20 percent mark, it will have been the most severe correction for the s&p500 in recent memory that didn't morph into an official bear market. doug ramsey, director of research at the leuthold group, said in a recent report that he believed that the august swoon represented ''the second leg of a new bear market that began after the s&p500 and most global indexes topped on either april 29 or may 2. he looked at all major corrections in the s&p500 since 1950 that stopped just shy of a bear market. separately, a forecast of third-quarter earnings based on data by thomson reuters predicted that the earnings of s&p500 companies would rise 13.7 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 17 percent. only 17 of the 500 stocks in the s&p500 rose. two of the best-known stock market gauges in the world - the dow jones industrial average and the s&p500 - may share the same home under a deal being discussed.  if consummated, such a joint venture would be the first time the s&p500 and the dow lived under one

outperformed a benchmark -- in this case, the vanguard s&p500 index fund -- over that time. while some mutual fund managers may complain about measuring their funds' performance against the s&p500 index, most investors, for better or worse, gauge their returns and overall financial well-being against one of the major indexes. still, the s&p500 was up 13.58 percent so far this month, its highest monthly gain since october 1974, when it rose 16.3 percent in the month. the performance of the funds was measured against the vanguard s&p500 index fund, which had annual returns of 7.65 percent during that time. in fact, most funds underperformed the s&p500 about a third of the time. the rs investments small cap growth fund, for example, underperformed the s&p500 more than it

28.6 percent, while that fama/french index lost 10 percent. '' (if you are, you might also see years like 2001, where the fama/french index gained 40.6 percent while the s&p500 lost 11.9 percent. stocks could surge into the new year if the s&p500 passes a couple of crucial technical thresholds, said todd salamone, research director at schaeffer's investment research. a quick glance at the numbers shows that the s&p500 index of large domestic stocks has gone virtually nowhere since the technology bubble burst in 2000, while the barclays united states aggregate bond index has returned more than 6 percent a year, on average.  at the other end of the spectrum, mr. ablin argued, the group that clearly underperformed in recent years -- large blue-chip stocks in the s&p500 -- also seemed to be priced at attractive enough levels to bounce back. the s&p500 fell 15.79 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,249.64. the s&p500 rose 13.38 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,263.02. the all-in value of a portfolio of $1,000 worth of s&p500 shares acquired at the turn of the century is now just in the black, in nominal terms, despite the intervening crisis.  say an investor buys shares at 11 times forward earnings and sells in five years' time at the 25-year average s&p500 p/e ratio of 15 times. the last third year in which the s&p500 failed to show a gain was 1947, when it closed exactly unchanged. binky chadha, the chief strategist for deutsche bank, who forecast that the s&p500 would end closer to 1,500 in 2012, wrote in a market commentary that ''very healthy'' corporate fundamentals and cheap valuations would help equities eventually win out over the euro crisis and american fiscal issues. among the best 2011 performers in the s&p500 were utilities, up 14.8 percent; health care, up 10.2 percent; and consumer staples, 10.5 percent. in the third quarter, for example, earnings per share for companies in the s&p500 were $25.29, their highest ever for a quarter,

territory amid expectations that greece could soon default on its debt, only to rise by 4 percent in the last hour of trading. some sectors of the s&p500 fared well, like utilities and health care, while others, like the financial sector, were hit hard. for much of the decade leading up to the financial crisis in 2008, the measure of correlation between the 50 biggest stocks in the s&p500 generally stayed between 10 percent and 40 percent. the realized correlation within united states equities in the s&p500 is now higher than in 2008, mr. curnutt said. last month the well-known

global economic slowdown is starting to seep into corporate results. s&p500 dividends are expected to grow by nearly 11 percent in 2012, said howard silverblatt, senior index analyst at standard & poor's. historically, he said, the payout ratio has hovered around 50 percent for s&p500 companies. since 1962, the dividend yield of the s&p500 has averaged about 40 percent of the yield on 10-year treasury notes. the direction of the s&p500 in january has correctly foreshadowed whether stocks end the year higher or lower in 60 of the last 83 years, or about 72 percent of the time, according to

initial months of 2012. he noted that about 20 percent of american exports and s&p500 earnings come from europe. the authors are huge fans of buying index funds, but they add that ''indexing does not mean that an investor should hold only an s&p500 index fund or a total stock market fund. s&p500 companies, which beat analysts' estimates in the previous 11 quarters, are forecast to report a 6 percent increase in per-share profit during the september-december period, according to projections compiled by bloomberg. recent economic reports and optimism about the earnings season in the united

for 2012, helping to push the s&p500 up 4.5 percent for the year. improving economic data in the united states along with signs of euro zone stability has helped push the s&p500 up 4.6 percent to start the year. in fact, the morgan stanley capital international europe index and the s&p500 index of domestic stocks both rose in the days immediately after the news.  and since the united states was taken down a notch by s.& p. last august, the s&p500 has gained more than 9 percent. the only time it failed was after the oakland raiders won in 1984, and that year the s&p500 rose just 1.4 percent. the telecommunications sector had the biggest loss in the s&p500 among 10 groups, slumping 1.3 percent. the s&p500 lost 0.6 percent to 1,318.43. cambridge associates, an investment adviser

s&p500 returned only 2.82 percent.  late last year, he said, the correlation of individual stocks within the s&p500 ''exploded to insane, never-seen-before levels, so that all stocks look and behave almost the same. while sentiment had improved over the euro zone this year, with the s&p500 up 4.7 percent through friday, many investors still view the region with caution as setbacks in solving its sovereign debt problems could hamper international economic growth and erode domestic bank profits. according to thomson reuters data, of the 204 companies in the s&p500 that have reported results so far, 59.8 percent topped estimates, tracking below the beat rate at this stage of the earnings season in recent quarters. shortly after the opening bell, the s&p500 piereced a bullish technical level, known as a golden cross, as its 50-day average ticked above its 200-day average. in 26 golden crosses since 1962, the s&p500 gained an average 4.1 percent over the next three months and was

companies more precisely -- when making investing decisions. as earnings season wanes, 51 companies in the s&p500 are scheduled to report results this week. s&p500 hits a five-year high the new york

into account. the dow is 9.4 percent higher so far this year and the s&p500 is up 8.3 percent. the s&p500 has gained 129 percent since hitting its own bottom of 676 on the same date. more spectacularly, the stock market has more than doubled since 2009 and has been especially strong for the last six months, with the dow jones industrial average reaching record closing highs last week and the s&p500 flirting with superlatives, too. called the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or cape, this measure is the real, or inflation-adjusted, s&p500 index divided by a 10-year average of real s.& p. earnings. after six straight days of gains, the s&p500 closed friday just 14 points, or 0.9 percent, from the record high of 1,565.15 it hit in october 2007. the gains put the s&p500 just nine points away from its record closing high, which it reached in october 2007. so far this year, the dow has gained more than 10 percent, while the s&p500 is up more than 9 percent. the s&p500 index rose 5.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,556.22, just nine points shy of its record closing high of 1,565.15, which it reached on oct. 9, 2007. the s&p500 has risen 8.9 percent this year and is less than one percentage point from its nominal high close of 1,565.15, set in october 2007. david bianco, chief united states equity strategist at deutsche bank, said the s&p500 index would probably maintain its momentum in the coming weeks and surpass its nominal high. the s&p500 has gained 9 percent this year and is less than 11 points from its record close of 1,565.15 in october 2007. on thursday, the s&p500 ended within 2 points of the closing price of 1,565.15 it hit in october 2007. for the week, the s&p500 rose 0.6 percent. jpmorgan chase was the biggest drag on the s&p500 and one of the biggest weights on the dow, falling 98 cents, or 1.92 percent, to $50.02. the s&p500 lost 2.53 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,560.70. even with the stock market's pullback friday and monday, the dow is still up 10.3 percent this year, while the s&p500 is up 8.8 percent. the s&p500 is up 8.6 percent in 2013 and is 17 points from its nominal closing high of 1,565.15, reached on october 2007. the s&p500 is just six points below its milestone of 1,565, reached in october 2007. the s&p500 has gained 2.1 percent in march. the s&p500 was 7 points, or 0.3 percent, lower than it was at the start of trading on monday. the s&p500 index fell 5.20 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,551.69. the s&p500 rose to a session high of 1,564.91, a fraction of a point below its record closing high of 1,565.15 set on oct. 9, 2007. the s&p500 index rose 12.08 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,563.77, less than two points from the peak it reached on oct. 9, 2007, before the recession and the ensuing financial crisis battered the markets. all 10 industry groups in the s&p500 rose, with health care and energy companies leading the way. four of the 10 industry groups in the s&p500 index edged higher. even with the record level, the s&p500 is still not back to its 2007 level when inflation is taken into account. the s&p500 finished thursday up 0.4 percent, or 6.34 points, at 1,569.19. greenwich, conn.the dow jones and s&p500 indexes reached record highs on thursday, having completely erased the losses since the stock market's last peak, in 2007. since the s&p500 first reached its current level, in march 2000, the mad money printers at the federal reserve have expanded their balance sheet sixfold (to $3.2 trillion from $500 billion). the s&p500 dropped 7.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,562.17.  the s&p500 ended the first quarter at a high of 1,569.19, surpassing its previous record close of 1,565.15 on oct. 9, 2007. the s&p500 has gained an average of 1.4 percent in april, based on returns since 1960. women make up only 16 percent of directors at fortune 500 companies, 4 percent of chief executives at s&p500 companies and 10 percent of chief financial officers at s&p500 companies. the median age of a chief executive of an s&p500 company is 55, while the average age of a director is 62. the s&p500 was up 8.08 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,570.25. the s&p500 surpassed its 2007 closing high last thursday, while the dow first broke above its 2007 record on march 5. humana, which has a market cap of about $11.9 billion, has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, below the s&p500 p/e average ratio of about 16.5. all 10 industry groups in the s&p500 index fell. small-company stocks, which did better than the dow and the s&p500 in the first three months of the year, are more vulnerable to the economy than the larger companies in the dow and s.& p. that is because they rely far more on domestic sales than global giants like i.b.m. using data going back more than 60 years, mr. stovall says that the s&p500 has gained an average of 9 percent from april to december after rising in the first quarter. the s&p500 index gained 6.29 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,559.98. s&p500 earnings are expected to rise just 1.6 percent from a year ago, according to thomson reuters data, down from a jan. 1 growth forecast of 4.3 percent. somehow people are not impressed by the fact that the s&p500 has earnings that are about 80 percent higher than they were in 1999, when the index reached levels almost as high as those reached this year.  at the suggestion of bob barbera, the co-director of johns hopkins university's center for financial economics, i compared the earnings yield on the s&p500 to the yield on the bank of america merrill lynch high yield bond index since 1994. in 2008, the merrill lynch high-yield index fell 26 percent, while the total return of the s&p500 stock index was a negative 37 percent. jobs data cements a bad week for the s&p500 the s&p500 fell 6.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,553.28. with both the dow jones industrial average and the s&p500-stock index hitting new highs this week, and the s&p500 having already gained 10 percent in the first quarter, a growing chorus of analysts and financial advisers are warning investors that it is too late to join the rally. to find out, i used the s&p500 index, and looked for those points where the index hit a new high at least one year after its previous high. even in that case, when the s&p500 surpassed the previous high set in 2000, the five-year loss was modest. the best returns would have been realized by investors who bought in mid-1989, when the s&p500 surpassed the high previously set in october 1987, before the crash that year. ''it doesn't feel like 2000,'' he said, when he famously argued that the s&p500 was 50 percent overvalued. but an investor with a diversified portfolio -- anchored, say, by a s&p500 index fund, probably has enough health care investments already, said campbell r. harvey, a professor of international business at duke university.  that compares with 8.3 percent for the average health fund and 4.3 percent for the s&p500 over the same period. today's inflows may well be a bearish signal, too, though many investment advisers say stocks have two things going for them that they didn't have then, or even when the s&p500 last set a record. standard & poor's estimates that operating earnings per share for the s&p500 companies reached $96.83 in 2012, a record high, and analysts predict a figure of $111.14 for this year. the s&p500 price-earnings ratio remains below the median of the past couple of decades. in contrast, the average market cap of the s&p500 is nearly $14 billion. the s&p500 is up 9.6 percent for the year, while the dow has gained 11.5 percent. the s&p500 gained 5.54 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,568.61. while only 5 percent of s&p500 companies have reported results so far, almost three-quarters of those have topped expectations, according to thomson reuters data. analysts said, however, that the market has the momentum to push indexes higher, even with the dow industrials up 12 percent so far this year and the s&p500 up 10 percent. the s&p500 climbed 19.12 points, or 1.22 percent, to 1,587.73. the day was the best session for both the dow and the s&p500 since feb. 27, and the best for the nasdaq since jan. 2. with wednesday's gains, the dow is up about 13 percent so far this year, the s&p500 is up 11.3 percent and the nasdaq is up 9.2 percent. among the 5 percent of s&p500 companies that have reported their quarterly financial results so far, almost three-quarters have topped expectations, according to thomson reuters data. the s&p500 rose 5.64 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,593.37. the two major indexes finished the week with strong gains: the dow rose 2.1 percent, and the s&p500 rose 2.3 percent. the s&p500 dropped 2.3 percent, or 36.49 points, to 1,552.36 on monday. the s&p500 dropped 2.3 percent, or 36.49 points, to 1,552.36 on monday. still, the s&p500 is up 10.4 percent since the start of the year after enjoying a strong first-quarter run, partly as a result of the fed's continued stimulus efforts. the s&p500 gained 22.21 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,574.57. earnings for companies in the s&p500 are now expected to have risen 1.8 percent in the first quarter, based on actual results from 42 companies and estimates for the rest, up from a recent estimate of 1.1 percent growth. the market has had strong gains since the start of year, yet on monday, the s&p500 posted its worst day since nov. 7, falling 2.3 percent, after a sharp drop in gold prices. the s&p500 energy companies fell 1.9 percent and shares of chevron slid 1.9 percent to $114.81 and helped lead the declines in the dow. in a notable technical move, the s&p500 came close to falling below its 50-day moving average. s&p500 earnings are now expected to have risen 1.7 percent in the first quarter, based on actual results from 56 companies and estimates for the rest, according to thomson reuters data. the s&p500 ended below its 50-day moving average of 1,543.04 for the first time this year, giving more weight to analysts' concerns that the market's recent rally was losing momentum, particularly after two days of sharp declines this week.  the s&p500 dropped 10.40 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,541.61. mr. ross and other analysts noted that the s&p500 had posted negative second quarters in the last three years. the earnings of companies in the s&p500 are expected to have risen 1.9 percent in the first quarter, up from the 1.5 percent estimate at the start of the month, based on actual results from 82 companies and estimates for the rest, according to thomson reuters data. the slight gains on friday could not overcome a tough week for the market, when both the s&p500 and the dow lost 2.1 percent. analysts estimate that earnings for companies in the s&p500 rose just 2 percent over the previous year, a slowdown from the 7.7 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 2012. next week will be another big week for earnings as 10 members of the dow and 181 companies in the s&p500 report results. about a third of the companies in the s&p500 index, including exxon mobil and apple, will report earnings this week. the s&p500 closed up 7.25 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 1,562.50. last week the s&p500 and the dow each lost 2.1 percent, paring their advances after a strong start to the year. with the s&p500 valued at about $14.6 trillion at the time of the false twitter post, the plunge briefly wiped out $136.5 billion of the index's value.  earnings season has been largely positive, with more than 68.9 percent of s&p500 companies that have reported results so far beating expectations, according to thomson reuters data. the benchmark s&p500 index has risen 2.4 percent over the last three sessions. sixty-nine percent of companies in the s&p500 have beaten earnings expectations, better than the 10-year average of 62 percent, according to s&p capital iq. the s&p500 index was up 0.01 point, to 1,578.79. the market's gains in april have slowed sharply after a first-quarter surge pushed both the dow and the s&p500 to nominal highs. the dow is up just 0.7 percent this month while the s&p500 has gained 0.6 percent. during the first three months of the year, the dow and the s&p500 averaged monthly gains of more than 3 percent, driven by optimism that the housing and job markets were recovering and that company earnings would continue to climb. analysts said while investors could find alternatives to s&p500 options, few good alternatives were available for the vix index. "we would be having a very different conversation if the s&p500 was down 50 points or more," said mark sebastian, the chief operating officer of option pit, an educational and consulting firm. analysts said while investors could find alternatives to s&p500 options, few good alternatives were available for the vix index. ''we would be having a very different conversation if the s&p500 was down 50 points or more,'' said mark sebastian, the chief operating officer of option pit, an educational and consulting firm. the s&p500 gained 6.37 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,585.16. analysts sharply lowered their earnings expectations before the start of the current reporting season, and 68 percent of the s&p500 companies that have reported results have exceeded earnings forecasts. the s&p500 dropped 2.92 points on friday, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,582.24. both the s&p500 and the dow were up for the week and remain slightly below their nominal highs reached april 11. the nasdaq, heavy on technology stocks, has lagged the dow and the s&p500 this year, but it led the way higher this week, lifted by microsoft. the s&p500 index rose 11.37 points, to close at 1,593.61. ''the market has had a terrific run,'' said philip orlando, chief equity strategist at federated investors, noting that the s&p500 is up 12 percent since the start of 2013. tech shares help lift s&p500 the broad-market measure ended april with a 1.8 percent gain, the sixth consecutive month that the s&p500 has moved higher. the s&p500 edged up 3.96 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,597.57. more than half of the companies in the s&p500 have turned in results, and seven of 10 have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings, according to s&p capital iq. technology stocks have surged in the past two weeks, after lagging the s&p500 in the first three months of the year. s&p500 surpasses 1,600 as job gains top forecast the s&p500 climbed 1.05 percent, or 16.83 points, to 1,614.42. the gains built on a nearly two-week rally that has brought the s&p500 up 13.2 percent for the year and the dow up 14.27 percent for the year. in case you're keeping score, mr. buffett's ahead in a bet with hedge funds over the performance of the s&p500 versus a fund of funds. more than 80 percent of the companies in the s&p500 have reported results for the first quarter and, by and large, they fared well, he said. in the quarter, sales reported so far at s&p500 companies -- which include revenue from faster-growing markets like china's -- were virtually flat, according to thomson reuters i/b/e/s. but mr. clissold said the lack of meaningful sales growth for s&p500 companies concerned him. s&p500 hits record in quiet trading a jump in apple's shares helped lift the s&p500 and the nasdaq composite index modestly. the s&p500 has gained 13.4 percent this year. the s&p500 inched up 3.08 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,617.50. although weak economic data from the euro zone and china has caused concerns about the outlook for global growth, the stronger-than-expected april employment report fueled gains that sent the dow and the s&p500 to new nominal record levels last friday. the multibillionaire investor warren e. buffett said on monday that stocks were ''reasonably priced,'' although the dow and the s&p500 had hit nominal highs. more than 400 of the s&p500 companies have turned in first-quarter results, and more than seven out of 10 have beaten wall street's expectations, according to s&p capital iq. more than 400 of the s&p500 companies have turned in first-quarter results, and more than seven out of 10 have beaten wall street's expectations, according to s&p capital iq. more than 400 of the s&p500 companies have turned in first-quarter results, and more than seven out of 10 have beaten wall street's expectations, according to s&p capital iq. materials and information technology companies gained the most of the 10 industry groups in the s&p500 index. the s&p500 index rose 6.73 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,632.69, extending its advance for 2013 to 14.5 percent. in fact, only 23 percent of s&p500 firms have a truly independent director as chairman. the s&p500 declined 6.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,626.67. apple helped lead the declines of both the s&p500 and the nasdaq, falling $4.02, or 0.9 percent, to $456.77. despite the day's declines, the dow is up 15.1 percent so far this year, while the s&p500 is up 14.1 percent. on thursday, the s&p500 broke a five-day streak of new closing highs. the s&p500 was up 7.03 points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,633.70. the s&p500 is up 14.6 percent for the year. hedge funds did help cushion the market decline in fiscal year 2009, when the s&p500 dropped about 26 percent. the s&p500 health care sector climbed 0.7 percent and was the day's best performer.  the day's flat close came after a third straight week of gains on the major indexes, with both the dow and s&p500 setting record closing highs last week. the s&p500 remains up 14.5 percent for the year so far. with 90 percent of the s&p500 having reported, 67.2 percent of companies topped earnings expectations, according to thomson reuters data. for instance, one proxy for large-cap stocks is the spdr s&p500 exchange-traded fund, which lost nearly 38 percent in 2008. the s&p500 financial sector index rose 1.7 percent. during the session, the dow hit an intraday high, not adjusted for inflation, of 15,219.55, while the s&p500 climbed to a similar intraday high of 1,651.10. with 90 percent of the s&p500 companies having reported results, 67.2 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to thomson reuters data, even with the average over the last four quarters. during trading, the dow touched a record intraday high at 15,301.34, while the s&p500 reached a record intraday peak at 1,661.49. the fed's purchases of $85 billion a month in bonds have been a significant driver of the rally in equities that has taken indexes to highs and pushed the s&p500 up nearly 16 percent this year. the s&p500 fell 8.31 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 1,650.47. in a sign of how far the market has come, the s&p500 is about 1,000 points above the low it hit in march 2009 in the wake of the credit crisis and recession. for the week, the dow advanced 1.7 percent, while the s&p500 climbed 2.1 percent and the nasdaq rose 1.9 percent. j. p. morgan raised its year-end target for the s&p500 to 1,715 from 1,580, implying a gain of just under 3.5 percent for the index for the rest of the year. earlier, the dow climbed to an intraday high at 15,391.84, and the s&p500 edged up to a new intraday record at 1,672.84. the s&p500 is up nearly 1,000 points from its low in march 2009. more than 38 percent of the stocks within the s&p500 hit a 52-week high last week -- the highest percentage since at least 1990. the s&p500 shed 1.18 points, or 0.07 percent, to finish at 1,666.29. seven of every 10 companies in the s&p500 have topped wall street's earnings forecasts, according to s&p capital iq. mr. bernanke indicated that he was not particularly worried that the stock market was moving into bubble territory, despite the 16 percent surge in the s&p500 since the beginning of the year. the stimulus has been a major force behind a rally in united states equities that has helped the s&p500 and the dow industrials to double-digit gains. the s&p500 was down 13.81 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,655.35. the s&p500 rose as high as 1,687.18 and fell as low as 1,648.86 in wednesday's trading session while the dow rose as high as 15,542.40 and fell as low as 15,265.96. those charts reflect msci indexes, based in dollars, in each country except the united states, where the s&p500 is used. by the time mr. roosevelt died in 1945, the s&p500 was 141 percent higher than it had been when he took office. the s&p500 edged down only 0.91 of a point, or 0.06 percent, to close at 1,649.60. in all, the average rate for the s&p500 was 29.1 percent over last six years. the fact that our effective tax rate is lower than some other companies in the s&p500 is reflective of the fact that less than 20% of our volume comes from sales in the u.s., which has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. the average rate for the companies in the s&p500 was 29.1 percent.  monetary stimulus from central banks has been a major contributor to wall street's gains this year, lifting the s&p500 more than 15 percent. mr. stovall noted that s&p500 has had a temporary pullback of at least 5 percent every year since the end of the world war ii, which has not happened yet in 2013. the s&p500 index was down 11.70 points to 1,648.36, also 0.7 percent. the price-to-earnings ratio for financial companies is 14.4 for banks and insurers, compared with 16.2 for all companies in the s&p500 index, according to factset. the s&p500 rose in early trading, climbing as much as 13.55 points, or 0.8 percent, by late afternoon. one of my current favorites compares the nasdaq in 1999 and 2000 to the s&p500 index in 2013. then there's the s&p500 itself. that's the fastest start for the s&p500 since 1987, when it rose 18.7 percent during the same time period. in fact the s&p500 is full of patterns if you're looking for them. if that pattern repeats, it could indicate that the stock market rally, which carried the s&p500 to record levels in may, will not last much longer. as it happens, the s&p500 was a little below 1,500 in 1999, and again in 2007, and again this past january, when margin debt rose to 2.25 percent of g.d.p. the s&p500 ended may up 2.1 percent, its seventh straight month of gains -- the longest streak since 2009. the s&p500 lost 23.67 points, or 1.43 percent, to finish at 1,630.74. for the week, the dow fell 1.2 percent, the s&p500 lost 1.1 percent, and the nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent. in may 2012, the s&p500 fell 6.3 percent. to replace heinz in the s&p500 the s&p500 index closed higher for a seventh straight month in may, but the index also logged its first back-to-back weekly declines since november. the dow is still up 16.4 percent this year, and the s&p500 is 15 percent higher. to replace heinz in the s&p500  . the s&p500 fell 9.04 points to close at 1,631.38, a loss of 0.6 percent. the company's inclusion in the index is expected to buoy the stock price, as investment funds that mimic the composition of the s&p500 buy up shares of its newest components. the company's inclusion in the index is expected to buoy the stock price, as investment funds that mimic the composition of the s&p500 buy up shares of its newest components. the s&p500 had run up to a record high on may 21, partly on the belief that softer economic data would ensure that the fed would keep its stimulus measures in place, as opposed to scaling them back earlier than expected. the current dividend yield for the s&p500 is 2.07 percent, according to bloomberg. the s&p500 is up more than 15 percent since the start of the year, but markets have been bumpier since comments from the fed chairman, ben s. bernanke, last month sparked uncertainty over the central bank's timeline for slowing its $85 billion a month bond purchase program. two of the top-performing stocks in the s&p500 this year, netflix and best buy, led consumer discretionary companies down. all 10 industry groups within the s&p500 rose, led by retailers and other consumer-discretionary companies. the s&p500 rose 17 percent from the start of the year to may 21 when it hit a high of 1,669. banks led nine of the 10 industry groups in the s&p500 lower. the s&p500 hit a record of 1,669 on may 21. telecommunications was the only one of the 10 industry sectors in the s&p500 to post a loss. netflix did better than any other stock in the s&p500 after announcing that it would run original tv series from dreamworks animation.  on wednesday, the s&p500 fell 1.4 percent. for the year, the s&p500 index is still up 11.4 percent. but the corporations in the s&p500 are reporting historically strong profits. the companies in the s&p500 have a stock market value that is 15 times as large as their expected combined earnings for this year. stocks did recover a bit on friday, with the s&p500 rising 4.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,592.43, and the dow jones industrial average climbing 41.08 points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,799.40. the s&p500 recovered from large losses early in the day to finish down 19.34 points, to 1,573.09, on monday. the s&p500 recovered from large losses early in the day to finish down 19.34 points, to 1,573.09, on monday. the s&p500 has fallen 3.5 percent in june, and is on track for its worst monthly performance since may 2012. the s&p500 gain of just under 1 percent was the biggest since june 13 and was the market's most broad-based advance
